    "text": "7910\n\n1 MILLION DISPLACED PEOPLE FROM AL HUDAYDAH GOVERNORATE ASSISTED IN SIX MONTHS\n\nHumanitarian partners delivered rapid response mechanism (RRM) assistance to at least 166,100 families (over 996,600 individuals) displaced by the conflict in Al Hudaydah Governorate across the country in the last six months. Between June 2018 and 15 January 2019, displaced Al Hudaydah families across the country reached 174,717 (over 1,048,300 individuals) including 109,867 families (over 659,300 individuals) registered in 4 governorates - Hajjah, Mahwit, Raymah and Al Hudaydah.\n\nUN agencies and NGOs operating in Al Hudaydah Governorate scaled up the delivery of assistance to people affected by the fighting, even though access to humanitarian facilities and the people in need remains a challenge. Humanitarian warehouses, including the\n\nRRM JUNE - DECEMBER 2018\n\nRed Sea Mills, where enough food is stored to feed 3.5 million people for a month, remains inaccessible. Other key humanitarian facilities that remain closed include UNHCR, WFP and WHO warehouses, as well as the 22 May Hospital.\n\nMost people assisted by RRM partners are displaced within Al Hudaydah Governorate. Even before the recent escalation of conflict, needs across the governorate were significant with 60 per cent of the population requiring humanitarian assistance. Findings of the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) published on 7 December show that 17 out of the 26 districts in the Governorate are in an emergency food security situation.\n\nSource: UNFPA\n\nConflict has reduced in Al Hudaydah Governorate but hostilities have escalated in neighbouring Hajjah Gov- ernorate especially in Hayran and Mustaba districts as well as near Haradh town, causing civilian casualties. Partners report that an estimated 300 families have recently been displaced to Abs District. Other IDPs are\n\nliving in harsh conditions in Haradh town. Since June 2018, humanitarian partners have provided RRM assis- tance to 21,274 families (over 127,640 individuals) out of 23,177 families (over 139,060 individuals) displaced to Hajjah.\n\nCLUSTER AND PARTNER RESPONSES ACROSS AL HUDAYDAH HUB IN DECEMBER-JANUARY\n\nIn anticipation of the situation stabilizing in Al Hudaydah City, IOM is establishing three centers to register people who may return home. At least 57,000 displaced families (about 342,000 people) are projected to return to the city, if the situation improves. Partners have agreed on a response package for the potential returnees including a RRM kit, food, shelter and non-food items (NFIs)\n\nDuring the reporting period, the WASH Cluster installed a solar pump for Al Musharak water well in Al Garrahi District that serves 6,890 people, as well as three solar pumps and four water networks in Az Zuhrah District for 25,830 people. In Al Hudaydah City, UNICEF partners are providing trucked water to more than 7,000 displaced families. A WASH Cluster partner distributed 150 basic hygiene kits to an orphanage in the city.\n\nWFP dispatched 2,700 metric tons (MT) of food supplies from Al Hudaydah and Aden to At Tuhayat District in preparation for a blanket food distribution that will target 19,000 households in the area. The district has not been accessible for the past three months due to security concerns.\n\nUNHCR provided rental subsidies to 1,299 displaced families in Al Hudaydah City and 514 families in Hajjah Governorate; beneficiaries received $200 to cover rent for three months. UNHCR also provided winterization kits to 1,020 displaced families in Hajjah Governorate and rental subsidies to 514 families.\n\nUPDATES FROM HUBS\n\nSA\u2019ADA HUB\n\nArmed clashes and airstrikes were reported in several districts of Sa\u2019ada Governorate including Kitaf wa Al Boq\u2019ele Baqim, Razih, Adh Dhaher and As Safra. In Al Jawf Governorate, armed clashes reportedly continued in Al Maslub, Khabb wa ash Sha\u2019af, Al Maton, Barat Al Anan and Al Ghayl districts. A water project used by about 250 households in Sahar District was damaged along with houses and farms. Casualties were reported but numbers are unknown.",

For this purpose, we estimate the active number of COVID-19 cases at 35,500 persons in Syria till the end of July. Our estimations and projections reveal that, contrary to the unreliable low official number of cases, the country is at the edge of a severe uncontrolled outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nCurrently, a very limited number of containment mitigation measures are in place in Syria. Should this continue to be the case and with low improvement of public commitment, our modelling predicts around 2 million COVID-19 active cases by end of August 2020. If effective measures were introduced and were accompanied by public commitment, this would take the number of active cases down to about 100,000. It is important to emphasise that our projections are indicatives and in the absence of reliable data are based on various assumptions, but they form a\n\nThis research was supported by an LSE small grant for pilot research to support national and international responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and UK aid from the UK government. Authors email addresses: Z.Mehchy@lse.ac.uk and r.turkmani@lse.ac.uk\n\ngood start for policy discussions.\n\nIn our first scenario, we assume a severe outbreak, with an average R0 of 3 during August, which we believe is close to actual current value of R0 in Syria. This assumes the government does not introduce strict measures and the level of public and individual commitment and adherence to protective measures only improves slowly. Under such a scenario, we forecast that by the end of August, the total number of active COVID-19 cases would be 1.982 million and the total related deaths to be around 119,000. In the second scenario, we assume an increased awareness and adherence to measures but with limited improvement on the measures introduced by the authorities which would take the R0 value down to 2. We forecast that by the end of August, the total number of active COVID-19 cases would be 289,500 and the total related death to be around 17,400. In the third scenario, we assume the introduction of effective measures and increased awareness. We project that by the end of August, the total number of active COVID-19 cases would be 101,000 and the total related death to be around 6,100. In the final scenario, we assume a phased approach and a gradual decrease of R0 from 3 to 1.5. Under this scenario, we forecast that by the end of August, the total number of active COVID-19 cases would be 400,000 and the total related deaths to be around 24,100.\n\nThe acute situation requires urgent attention from the local authorities and international community to prevent an uncontrolled outbreak, the harm of which could threaten the regional and global health security. Any response plan should not to be based on the misleading official figures and should look into other alarming indicators on the ground.\n\nAlthough the official figures of COVID-19 cases in Syria stand around one thousand, many indicators, news, statements and our primary sources point at that the actual numbers are significantly higher. The situation seems to have exploded in the last few weeks. The burial office in Damascus reported a sharp increase in the daily number of people dying in Damascus since the 10th of July. According to the figures of Damascus burial office 133 people have died in Damascus on 29th of July. This is compared to 25 to 30 people dying per day around the same period in 2016. This four to five folds increase in the number of deaths corresponds to similar estimated that were given to us by Damascus hospital doctors whom we interviewed for our research. Although officials and doctors at public hospitals are discouraged from speaking publicly on the actual situation, increasing number of doctors and officials are breaking their silence and are speaking about much higher number of cases and that the health system reached its limit in its ability to deal with new cases. The deputy health director of Damascus for example estimated the actual number of cases in Damascus and its countryside to be around 112,000 cases2. In the northwest of the country the reported and estimated number of cases are still relatively low but they could be quickly affected by the outbreak in the government-controlled areas.",

WVSR\u2019s advocacy efforts concentrated on:\n\ncollecting data on access to vaccines for the refugee population in Jordan and Turkey;\n\nworking with the Syria INGO Regional Forum on the COVID-19 situation in Syria. The briefing was circulated to key stakeholders in all Capitals and with all relevant UN agencies;\n\nadvocacy on the basis of the Jordan Government\u2019s Defence Law. A letter, signed by WVUS, was circulated to the US Ambassador in Amman and USAID Mission Director;\n\nproviding principled humanitarian public responses on the increasing violations we have witnessed in North West Syria, including indiscriminate attacks, child abuse. We have issued at least three reactive statements over the past month;\n\npartnering with peer INGOs to advocate for the reopening of the border crossings into North of Syria and the renewal of the last remaining one \u2013 Bab Al Hawa \u2013 ahead of the UN Security Council vote on July 10. To date we have:\n\n\u2022 drafted and signed on at least four statements / letters; \u2022 lobbied with Member States and met with UN agencies to coordinate the activities in North West of Syria;\n\n\u2022 engaged with all of our World Vision UN offices and colleagues in Capitals to strengthen our engagement with donors and political stakeholders on the issue under debate.\n\nBased on the above actions, WVSR aims to use its global reach and local connections to encourage vaccine acceptance and uptake by the world\u2019s most vulnerable communities to save lives, protect\n\nlivelihoods, and safeguard families and children from impoverishment and violence. WVSR also aims to call for a principled humanitarian response in Syria, based on needs; for this, access to the most vulnerable is needed and must be fully guaranteed.\n\nIn addition to insecurity and critical economic challenges, the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic continue to be one of several factors contributing to increased humanitarian needs across the country, with an estimated 13.4 million people requiring assistance in 2021. Syria remained unstable and volatile, with the main hotspots of insecurity in AlHasakeh, Ar-Raqqa, Aleppo, Dara\u2019 and Idlib",

Since mid-April, increased hostilities on the west coast districts of Taizz, including Dhubab, Mawza and Al- Wazi\u2019iyah districts, have limited humanitarian partners\u2019 access, both from Ibb and Aden governorates. The fighting also displaced more than 1,260 families into Abyan, Lahj and Aden governorates. In recent days, humanitarian access to parts of Al- Waziyah and Mawza districts has improved, including from Aden and Al-Turbah City. Humanitarian partners in Ibb and Aden Hubs are coordinating rapid assessments in accessible areas. Partners continue to identify safe routes into former conflict areas, as some locations are heavily contaminated with landmines and explosive remnants of war. Last week, the Local Council in Mawza requested assistance for 300 internally displaced families. Additional requests are expected in the coming days, as partners continue their needs assessments on the ground.\n\nTaizz governorate\n\nUPDATES FROM THE HUBS\n\nAl Hudaydah Hub: Local authorities in Al Hudaydah have reported that hundreds of families have fled ongoing military operations in Altuhayat District. An estimated 705 displaced families have arrived in Zabid and Al-Garrahi districts during the past couple of days; 250 families have been displaced within Altuhayat\n\nIn Hajjah Governorate, hundreds of families have fled hostilities along the coastal areas of Midi District to neighboring Abs and Hayran districts. Partners are identifying the displaced populations and assessing needs. Initial information indicates that most of the displaced families are already IDPs who have been displaced for the second time. Further displacement is anticipated in the coming days as the Midi frontline continues to move along the coastal areas towards Hayran District.\n\nAden Hub: Since December 2017, the total number of families displaced to areas accessible by the Aden\n\nHub has reached 15,678 households as of 13 May. Most new IDPs have come from Taizz, Al Hudaydah and Al Bayda governorates. During the reporting period, humanitarian partners continued to respond to the needs of the affected people. WFP and UNICEF availed 1,000 rapid response kits for pre-positioning in Al Mokha and Al Khawkhah.\n\nSana\u2019a Hub: The Protection Cluster produced its latest Civilian Impact Monitoring (CIMP) weekly report for Amanat Al Asimah (Sana\u2019a City), Sana\u2019a and Marib governorates, covering the period between 10-16 May. According to the report, there were five reported incidents, a 55 per cent drop from the previous week. The five incidents were caused by airstrikes. These resulted in four civilian casualties, which was a significant drop-off from the 112 casualties in the previous week. Airstrikes on a glass factory in Nihm were assessed to have a direct protection implication for as many as 100 households, which may have lost their livelihoods. Airstrikes also hit a gas station in the Al-Qoladh area\n\nof Bani Matar, potentially causing as many as 2,000 households in the area to experience restricted access to gas supply.\n\nIbb Hub: During the reporting period, heavy rains in Ma\u2019afer District, Taizz Governorate, damaged about 580 tents at an IDP hosting site, according to the Shelter/ NFI/CCCM Cluster. In Mawza District, local authorities have appealed to the humanitarian community to assist about 300 displaced families. Humanitarian clusters and partners are following up on the request.\n\nSa\u2019ada Hub: On 16 May, UNFPA reported delivering seven reproductive health kits to Al Jawf Governorate. Each kit can treat between 10,000-30,000 patients for three months. On 14 May, the new building of Haydan Hospital in Haydan District was inaugurated with support from a medical organisation.\n\nThe hospital had been damaged by conflict in October 2015. The organisation returned to the hospital and started working in the staff residence and two tents in the hospital yard in 2017, providing health services to 7,000 people, of whom 44 per cent were children under 5 years and 41 per cent were women.",

    "text": "32643\n\nUPDATE No 19\n\nOn 19 June, the Superintendence for Migrations (SNM for its acronym in Spanish) announced the implementation of a Migratory Information Registry to record data at the border points. This new regulation aims to strengthen the SNM\u2019s border monitoring and security. On 22 June, the Special Commission for Refugees (CEPR) resumed its online appointment system. Through this service, asylum seekers with pending and new applications can complete the needed requirements. Completed applications allow the printing of working permits. Up to 25 June some 4,700 asylum applications have been registered, with Piura and Trujillo as the locations in which the larger number have been submitted outside of Lima. On 23 June, the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations (MIMP) informed that during the State of emergency some 700 children and adolescents were assisted countrywide, through the Special Protection Units (UPE). Further information available here. Peru scaled up to number six in the global COVID-19 ranking with more than 268,000 cases confirmed.\n\nSexual and reproductive health services from the State to assist refugees and migrants from Venezuela and host communities remain limited to births and emergencies. Prenatal care and family planning services are highly constraint.\n\nProtection, Education, Health\n\nThe GTRM is supporting access to birth registration procedures for refugee and migrant parents with babies born during the COVID-19 emergency. Partners are working with the relevant authorities to guarantee Education and Integration partners are establishing a database to avoid the duplication of refugees and migrants assisted through higher education initiatives, namely the validation of their professional studies and academic degrees. Health partners are mapping confirmed COVID-19 cases among refugees and migrants in shelters. Partners are coordinating with the Ministry of Health on the elaboration of information materials, providing health professionals with mental health support, distributing protective equipment to personnel in hospitals, and on the implementation of safety protocols within health infrastructures.\n\nOPERATIONAL MEASURES\n\nTo date, USD 2,400,000 have been distributed on Cash-Based Interventions (CBI) in support of 53,000 refugees and migrants in Peru. Distributions focused in Lima, Arequipa, Callao, Cusco, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Madre de Dios, Piura, Tacna and Tumbes. GTRM partners have provided more than 41,000 general orientations, assisted almost 3,200 refugees and migrants with legal counseling and managed some 6,600 cases during the emergency. As winter temperatures set it, nearly 10,000 vulnerable persons have been assisted with winter support. Some 270 persons living with HIV and 210 pregnant women were supported with health appointments.\n\nREFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ASSISTED.",

    "text": "50904\n\n10 years in, conflict continues to wreak havoc across the whole of Syria with civilians suffering from extreme levels of insecurity and indiscriminate attacks.1 Crime, safety, and deteriorating socio-economic conditions further contribute to the growing death toll, which has reached an estimated 600,000 people. Airstrikes, artillery shelling, localized fights, and improvised explosive devises continue to threat everyone, especially children who pay the highest price. Reaching them and the most vulnerable populations remains a challenge as humanitarian access further restricts aid delivery to all those who are in dire need of assistance. These obstacles are not limited to the physical constraints, such as risks from conflict activities or environmental hazards. They are further complicated by international sanctions, financial restrictions and requirements by local authorities.\n\nCOVID-19 has added another layer of vulnerabilities to Syrian children and their families, and the Syrian population is on the brick of collapse into the worst food insecurity crisis so far as people lost employment and income generation activities \u2013 1.3 million are already food insecure and 1.8 more at high risk, according to World Food Program. This has a crippling effect on children\u2019s ability to continue education and learning, leading to an increase in child labour and forced early marriage incidents as parents and caregivers see no other option. But the real solution is in the hands of those who have the power to stop the fighting and end the violence against girls, boy, men and women.\n\nJordan remains the second largest refugee hosting country in the region. Since the war broke out inside Syria, Jordan welcomed a large number of Syrians fleeing for a safe haven. Until end of last year, 633,314 registered Syrian refugees2 were estimated to be living in one of Jordan\u2019s camps or in the communities (81% are living in the host communities). However, the real total of Syrians is believed to be around the total number of 1,300,000, including those not registered.3 Half of them are reported to be children.4\n\nThe Syrian refugee crisis has exacerbated the political, social, economic, and resource challenges in the country. As the protracted conflict in Syria reaches a 10 year milestone, and COVID-19 secondary effects destabilize the country, poverty levels are increase by around 38 percentage points (p.p.) among Jordanians, and by 18 p.p. among Syrian refugees, noting that refugees started off at a higher rate of poverty at baseline.5 Syrian refugee children are also affected experiencing higher levels of stress, sadness and isolation due to inability to attend formal or informal education - only 25% are enrolled in secondary school, which is 47% lower than Jordanian children.6 The socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 has increased reliance on negative coping mechanisms, compounded by limited livelihood options and access to social protection, despite modest increases in cash assistance supporting Syrian refugees. Children have been adversely impacted by the pandemic as an estimated 8 out of 10 families have been forced to adopt negative coping mechanisms that include child labor.7\n\nTurkey remains the largest refugee hosting country in the world with 3,643,769 Syrian refugees estimated to be living in the country8; 1.6 million are reported to be registered Syrian children. The actual numbers of Syrian refugees are much higher and those without a Temporary Protection Identification are the most marginalised and with limited or no access to basic care. After ten years since the first group of 252 Syrian refugees reached Turkey9, the response to the refugee crisis has shifted from a moral responsibility to strengthened borders and increased controls. This also meant that countless Syrians were unable to cross and had to stay in makeshift camps, after the visa-free policy for Syrians was halted in 2016.10\n\nAlthough Turkey has done a remarkable job in hosting refugees, the political climate in Europe and in country, the economic situation as well as the continued numbers of refugees seeking safety in the country, has increased tensions at community level have negative public perceptions towards refugees have grown significantly. This has led to several measures taken over past years including relocations to the Turkish provinces of first registration.11 Meanwhile, the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole of Syria response has resulted in 2,734,836 confirmed cases with Turkey being the most affected accounting for almost 80% of all reported cases in the region.12 Those still living in camps close to the Syrian border are at risk of catching the virus and with limited access to medical care to prevent, treat and contain the virus amongst this vulnerable",

    "text": "56855\n\nOPERATIONAL UPDATE\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo April 2021\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, UNHCR DRC is producing a condensed monthly Operational Update. Specific information about UNHCR\u2019s response to COVID-19 in DRC can be found here.\n\nDuring the month under review, 15,189 households were forced to flee their homes in Kalehe Territory (South Kivu Province) because of violent clashes between Hutu and Tembo militias caused by inter- communal land conflict. The families are scattered in nearly 25 neighbouring villages. UNHCR and partners are identifying the most urgent needs to coordinate the appropriate response through the Protection Cluster.\n\n26,000 Burundian refugees and asylum seekers have been physically verified and registered by UNHCR and the Commission Nationale pour les R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s (CNR) in Lusenda Camp and Mulongwe Settlement. All registered refugees will receive new refugee cards to offer protection and facilitate their mobility in the area.\n\nUNHCR and CNR facilitated the voluntary repatriation of 822 Burundian refugees from Kavimvira transit center in Uvira, DRC to Burundi. Due to the heavily damaged roads in South Kivu, refugees had to be relocated by boat from Lusenda Camp to Uvira. In addition, 221 Rwandan refugees were repatriated from North Kivu to Rwanda.\n\n4,292 Central African refugees (978 households) have been verified and registered by UNHCR and its governmental partner the Commission National pour les R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s (CNR) in Nzakara, 35 km from Gbadolite (North Ubangi Province). The majority of the refugees originate from the localities of Zangba and Mobaye Banga (Basse Kotto territory) and have arrived in DRC between January and March 2021. By the end of April, about 53,000 individuals had been registered by UNHCR in the three provinces of Bas Uele, North\n\nOPERATIONAL UPDATE > DR Congo / April 2021\n\nUbangi and South Ubangi, with approximately 37% among those already present in UNHCR database and 63% registered for the first time.\n\nTo strengthen the protection of South Sudanese refugee children at risk, two Best Interest Determination (BID) panel refresher workshops were held in Aru and Faradje territory in April, targeting 44 participants including 27 humanitarian actors from implementing partners and 17 officials from government structures (Peace Court, representatives from the Division of Social Affairs, Division of Primary, Secondary and Technical\n\nWith UNHCR support, 3,738 urban Rwandan and Burundian refugees in Goma and Bukavu were enrolled in medical insurance plans. Having access to basic health care improves the overall quality of life of refugees and prevents refugees from being pushed into extreme poverty. For 2021, an additional 158 urban refugees are awaiting enrolment in the medical insurance scheme in Goma.\n\nUNHCR continues to promote refugees\u2019 access to life-saving and essential healthcare. During April, 5,911 consultations were carried out by UNHCR\u2019s medical partners for Burundian refugees and host community members.\n\nWATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE (WASH)\n\nUNHCR continues to provide access to clean water at Lusenda Camp and Mulongwe settlement and to ensure chlorinated handwashing stations are in place at all entry points. In addition, 5,422 refugees were informed on domestic waste disposal and to improve the hygiene in their living environment.\n\nHygiene and sanitation promotion activities were carried out during the month of April by a team of 6 hygiene and sanitation promoters targeting 2,827 refugees residing in the Bele site, Haut-Uele Province.\n\nSHELTER AND CORE RELIEF ITEMS (CRIs)\n\nUNHCR implementing partner AIDES built 13 emergency shelters in the Mulongwe settlement for the benefit of Burundian refugee households who were relocated during the month of April. 110 additional shelters are currently being constructed. In addition, 148 of these recently relocated Burundian refugee households have benefited from a distribution of construction kits and technical support which will allow them to build their individual houses and latrines.",

Displacement is affecting the capacity of institutions to provide basic social services due to absence of staff. Access to water in the city has improved following repairs to pipes that had been damaged by conflict. Many roads in the city remain blocked, but the city remains accessible from Sana\u2019a.\n\nDisplacement continues as families seek shelter in relatively safer districts RRM kits for distribution in Marawi\u2019ah District.

WHO reports that while the emergence of new virus variants is common, those with higher speed of transmission or potentially increased pathogenicity (i.e. the capacity of a microbe to cause damage in a virus mutation (B117) and steer the response accordingly.\n\nMOPH Figures: As of 4 February, MoPH data shows that 55,256 people across all 34 provinces in Afghanistan are confirmed to\n\nhave had COVID-19. Some 47,995 people have recovered, and 2,407 people have died \u2013 at least 87 of whom are healthcare workers. Only 258,011 people out of a population of 40.4 million positive tests as a percentage of total tests \u2013 of 21 per cent, public health resources and testing capacity, lack of people coming forward for testing, as well as the absence of a national death choosing not to get tests and risk communications work is critical to\n\nA second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed in Source: MoPH November 2020 by the Ministry of Public Health. While three had been some signs the number of new cases was slowing in early January, MoPH tracking data has recently seen an uptick in cases, with an average of 45 cases a day between 27 January and 2 February. WHO Afghanistan remains concerned about mutations of the virus. WHO has sent recent COVID-19 samples for genomic sequencing to track for variants and confirm if the mutation is currently present in Afghanistan. WHO suspects this to be the case and reiterates that vigilance should be maintained.\n\ntreat patients with COVID-19, as well as maintaining essential health services, especially in areas of active conflict. WHO stresses the need to balance the demands of responding directly to COVID-19, with simultaneously engaging in strategic planning and coordinated action to maintain essential health service delivery, mitigating against the risk of system collapse. Almost eight per cent of the total confirmed COVID-19 cases are among healthcare staff and they will be the highest priority when vaccines are available. Health facilities across the country continue to report shortfalls in PPE, medical supplies and equipment, further challenging their capacity to treat COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need are now operating in Afghanistan, the capacity of these facilities remains limited and stocks of supplies have periodically run out. National capacity for COVID-19 testing has topped 5,800 a day however these laboratories are not being fully utilised. Humanitarian partners urge the Government to ensure laboratories are appropriately equipped, staff receive timely remuneration and that procured supplies go to under-resourced health centres in a transparent manner so that life-saving support can be delivered to those most in need.\n\nVaccination: The Government of Afghanistan and the UN have initiated a number of steps to prepare for the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine across the country, including the development of a National Vaccine Deployment Plan (NVDP). A technical working group comprised of government and UN organisations and chaired by the Ministry of Public Health has developed plans for vaccine operations, cold chain management, communication, surveillance, training and monitoring and evaluation/data, and will complement the existing Vice Presidential COVID-19 Task Force. So far, India has pledged to donate 500,000 doses (one person requires two doses to have a complete course) of its domestically-produced COVID-19 vaccine to Afghanistan which may arrive to the country as soon as the first half of this month. This vaccine is in the process of approval by WHO. Health workers will be prioritised to receive some 128,000 doses. Some 100,000 further doses have been earmarked for humanitarian caseloads through the COVAX facility, using funding from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, although details on how the logistics costs of distribution will be managed are still under discussion. Further discussions are also underway with China on potential donation of additional vaccines.",

This is attributed to cumulative shocks, including erratic 2020 Gu season, widespread and severe seasonal flooding, desert locust infestation, socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 and protracted conflict -and flood-related\n\nAccording to the 2020 Post Gu Seasonal Food Security and Nutrition Analysis for September (FAO/FSNAU), an estimated 1.3 million people are facing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) outcomes through September 2020, even in the presence of humanitarian assistance. This number is expected to increase to 2.1 million people through December 2020, in the absence of humanitarian assistance. An additional 2.5 million people are Stressed (IPC Phase 2), bringing the total number of people experiencing acute food insecurity to 3.8 million. In addition, 849,900 children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition over the next 12 months (September 2020 to August 2021), including 143,400 likely to be severely\n\nThe 2020 gu season exhibited erratic performance, with rains starting as early as late March in many parts of Somalia, then intensified in April, with heavy rain leading to riverine and flash floods through September, impacting food security according to FSNAU. The 2020 Gu harvest in southern Somalia is reportedly 40 per cent lower than the long-term average for 1995- 2019, mainly due to successive and severe flooding, erratic rainfall, a prolonged dry spell and protracted insecurity/conflict.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nHumanitarian Bulletin, 4 October 2020 | 2\n\nIn northwest regions, the 2020 Gu/Karan cereal production (harvest expected in November) is estimated at 45 per cent lower than the average for 2010-2019, mainly due to erratic rainfall.\n\nThe current and projected levels of acute food insecurity and malnutrition in Somalia remain high although both the magnitude and severity are lower compared to earlier projections. This is in part due to support provided by the Government and large scale and sustained humanitarian assistance that have prevented the worsening of food security and nutrition outcomes across many parts of Somalia. According to the Somalia Food Security Cluster, an average of 1.85 million people received food assistance monthly from April to August. Approximately 400,000 people also benefitted from government-led rural and urban safety net programmes. In April, the Government enacted a 20 to100 per cent tax exemption on imported food commodities in order to mitigate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on the population.\n\nHumanitarian needs are likely to increase in 2021 due to the influence of a La Nina that is currently developing (75 per cent chance through February 2021). Potential drought conditions will likely develop as a result of below average 2020 deyr (October to December), a harsh 2021 dry jilaal (January to March) season and a possible delay and/or poor performance of the 2021 gu (April to June).\n\nFood Security partners have recommended sustained support through December 2020 to address the urgent needs of the people who are likely to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4), and livelihoods for people in Stressed or worse (IPC Phase 2 or higher), who are likely to slide into Crisis or Emergency when they are unable to cope with shocks. Urgent nutrition and health support is required to address the needs, including for areas with high prevalence of acute maternal malnutrition.",

    "text": "63075\n\nSouthern Africa 1 - 30 June 2021\n\nCOVID-19 RESPONSE\n\nSince UNHCR\u2019s COVID-19 response began in Southern Africa in March 2020\n\n2.8 million people reached through COVID-19 risk\n\n2.2 million individuals received soap to promote handwashing and reduce the spread of COVID-19\n\n131 government health facilities and 36 camp and settlement- based health facilities\n\nPopulation Figures\n\n7,576,742 people of concern to UNHCR in Southern Africa,\n\n763,119 refugees and 315,579 asylum-\n\n6,461,380 internally displaced persons\n\n36,664 other people of (as of 31 May 2021)\n\nCOVID-19 UPDATE > Regional Bureau for Southern Africa / June 2021\n\nOperational Context\n\nAs of 29 June 2021, the region reported 2,590,902 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the 16 countries covered by UNHCR\u2019s Regional Bureau for Southern Africa. This represents an increase of 409,901 recorded cases in June, and a 204 per cent increase in the number of active cases from the previous month. Countries including Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have reported an increase in COVID-19 rates, with some governments announcing the arrival of the \u201cthird wave\u201d. To combat the rising case numbers, COVID-19 prevention measures and restrictions have been continued or tightened in many of the affected countries. Additionally, arrival of the Delta variant has been confirmed in the region, including in the DRC, South Africa, and Zambia.\n\nUNHCR and partners have maintained protection services and other life-saving assistance throughout the COVID- 19 pandemic. Mitigation measures are in place at registration and distribution points, and hotlines and community structures support protection case management. UNHCR continues to focus on risk communication and awareness-raising to increase understanding about COVID-19, encourage compliance with prevention measures, and inform about available services. Health systems strengthening continues to be a priority, equipping health centres, training health workers, and establishing isolation and quarantine centres. Additional handwashing facilities continue to be installed and maintained, and additional soap continues to be distributed. UNHCR is also providing cash assistance and core relief items (CRIs) to those worst impacted by COVID-19 and related restrictions. Where schools have been closed, children and youth have been supported with virtual and distance learning, and as schools re-open they have been supported to implement COVID-19 preventive measures.\n\nUNHCR is working closely with governments, the World Health Organization and other UN agencies and non- governmental organizations to secure the inclusion of persons of concern to UNHCR \u2013 refugees, asylum-seekers, IDPs, and stateless persons \u2013 into preparedness and response measures for COVID-19. Given the impacts on livelihoods and economic opportunities, UNHCR advocates for people of concern to UNHCR to be included into social safety nets and other social assistance programmes for COVID-19. Most countries in the region have been rolling out COVID-19 vaccination programmes. Following advocacy and engagement with governments, 11 countries have confirmed in June that refugees have access to vaccines, including Botswana, DRC, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Republic of the Congo (RoC), Zambia and Zimbabwe. While it is more difficult to track vaccination for persons of concern to UNHCR living in urban areas, countries such as South Africa have committed to including them in the national vaccination campaign alongside nationals.\n\nUNHCR Response Health and WASH\n\nThroughout the response to COVID-19 in Southern Africa, support to health systems and services has been a priority for UNHCR and partners, including equipping health centres, training health workers, supporting isolation and quarantine centres and establishing screening systems. Support to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) systems has also remained a priority in the region, as a preventive measure in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. In June, in Angola, 239 people in L\u00f3vua refugee settlement were provided with soap, with the aim of promoting handwashing and good hygiene as a way of reinforcing COVID-19 prevention. Throughout the COVID- 19 response in Angola, UNHCR and partners have provided more than 23,700 people with additional soap to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Meanwhile, in the DRC, UNHCR and partners distributed 250 face masks to refugees during repatriation to Burundi, while 1,500 masks were provided to health facilities in Fizi and Nundu health districts. UNHCR also provided 1,000 COVID-19 rapid test kits to health authorities in Bukavu, while in Haut Uele Province, 5,323 surgical masks were distributed to refugees as part of an infection prevention and control activity at the health centres in Biringi, Bele and Meri sites. Throughout the COVID-19 response, UNHCR and",

In Hajjah and Raymah governorates, in recent weeks, implementing partners have been held up on three separate occasions at checkpoints after returning from humanitarian missions. In Sa\u2019ada governorate, local authorities have in recent weeks raised concerns about the conduct of human- itarian assessments and cash-based interventions. In Al Jawf, an assessment survey has been delayed amid concerns by local authorities about planned ques- Such challenges are not new. The UN, international NGOs and national NGOs have all faced obstacles in the northern governorates for several years. Adminis- trative restrictions, insecure environments and inter- ference in assessments and delivery of assistance re- duce humanitarian actors\u2019 ability to operate in a safe, effective and principled manner. Area Humanitarian Country Teams continue to monitor these obstacles to ensure humanitarian organisations active in the affect- ed areas are aware about operational developments and appropriate responses are adopted.\n\nOngoing negotiations with relevant authorities, both in the governorates and Sana\u2019a, have made some progress in recent days in resolving misunderstand- ings, affirming humanitarian operational principles, and identifying possible solutions. The humanitarian leadership has received initial assurances that steps will be taken to expand humanitarians\u2019 ability to reach people in need and ensure access by communities to required services. On 22 February, at the request of the Humanitari- an Country Team, the Humanitarian Access Working Group (HAWG) met to discuss current access challeng- es in the northern governorates. The team agreed on the importance of developing a common approach, both among UN and NGO partners, towards prevail- ing challenges based on common operational guid- ance and humanitarian principles. The HAWG will continue to monitor the situation in the northern governorates, with a view to continue sup- porting ongoing engagement with local authorities, both in Sana\u2019a and the sub-offices, to find solutions to prevailing access constraints.\n\nUPDATES FROM THE HUBS\n\nHumanitarian organisations from the south are scoping ways to understand and address humanitarian needs in the area. On 24 February, an inter-agency mission trav- elled to Mukalla in Hadramaut governorate to engage authorities and partners, assess coordination mech- anisms and explore ways to enhance programmatic responses by the Aden Humanitarian Coordination Team to critical humanitarian needs in eastern Yemen. Ultimately, the plan is for the Mukalla hub to become\n\nThe eastern, northern fronts of Taizz city experienced fierce armed clashes between forces loyal to the GoY and Ansar Allah during the reporting period. Indiscrim- inate shelling was reported in residential areas of Taizz, as well as in Maqbanah and Al Wazyiah districts. Howev- er, clashes reduced in Jabal Habsahi, Sabir Al-Mawad- im and At Taizyiah districts. The clashes in Taizz have displaced some families to safer areas within Ibb and Taizz governorates. An assessment mission to the Taizz coastal districts of Al Mukha and Dhubab found an ur- gent need to scale-up health activities in these districts and to establish an effective referral mechanism. In Ibb, the situation is relatively calm although economic hardship is evident. The road connecting Ibb and Taizz Governorate through Al-Misrakh district has been re- opened after a temporary closure due to clashes and\n\nCivilian casualties were reported in Sa\u2019ada following a week of intense airstrikes, with 15 civilians reportedly killed when their vehicles were hit at the vicinity of Al Ammar checkpoint in As Safra district on 21 February. Unconfirmed reports the same week, indicated that six children and two women had been killed by another airstrike in Kitaf district. Fierce clashes were also report- ed in Al Jawf governorate, as GoY forces attempted to break through to Bart Al Anan district. Humanitari- an partners reported difficulties in implementing pro- grammes, including access challenges. There is ongo- ing discussion with authorities to facilitate assessments and information gathering activities.",

COVID-19 restrictions introduced in April to curb the spread of the virus after it was confirmed in South Sudan, added to the overall access constraints. During the rainy season which began in April 2020 and lasted until the end of the year, the most prominent constraint was the difficult physical environment. Up to 60 per cent of the roads in the country were cut off, hindering humanitarian organizations from accessing people in need of assistance and people from receiving aid.\n\nStructured focus group discussions were conducted in person and virtually with humanitarian organizations in mid-2020, covering the first half of the year and forecasting for the second, to determine levels of perceived humanitarian access across the 78 counties of South Sudan. Discussions were held with United Nations agencies, and international and national non-governmental organizations (INGOs and NNGOs) to take into consideration differing levels of actual or perceived access to people in need. The findings were averaged and applied to a three-point severity scale, ranging from \u2018accessible\u2019 to \u2018high access constraints\u2019, to indicate the overall severity of the access constraints of each county.\n\nThe below map captures the severity of access constraints by county, as perceived by humanitarian organizations. The results will enable the development of local access strategies to address the most common or challenging impediments in 2021, inform high-level advocacy on access, and guide operational planning to support targeted response to people\u2019s humanitarian needs in areas with severe access constraints.\n\nCOUNTIES BY SEVERITY LEVEL\n\nNumber of organizations who participated in the focus group discussions\n\nMedium 78 39 (50%)\n\ncounties experienced low access\n\nLow access constraints: No or very few access constraints present. Armed groups, checkpoints, bureaucratic or other access impediments may be present, but these rarely or only occasionally result in restrictions on humanitarian activities. Partners are largely able to operate. With adequate resources, partners would be able to reach all or nearly all targeted people in need.\n\ncounties experienced medium access\n\nMedium access constraints: Moderate access constraints present. Armed groups, checkpoints, bureaucratic or other access impediments are present and regularly result in restrictions on humanitarian activities. Operations continue in these areas with regular restrictions. With adequate resources, partners would be able to reach roughly half of targeted people in need.\n\ncounties experienced high access\n\nHigh access constraints: Significant access constraints present. Access is extremely difficult or impossible. Armed groups, checkpoints, bureaucratic or other access impediments are present and actively restrict humanitarian activities. Operations in these areas are often severely restricted or impossible. Even with adequate resources, partners would be unable to reach more than a minority of targeted people in need.\n\nCreation date: 04 January 2021 | Source: Focus group discussions | Feedback: accessreporting@un.org | unocha.org/south-sudan | southsudan.humanitarianresponse.info | @OCHASouthSudan | #NotATarget\n\nSOUTH SUDAN Humanitarian Access Severity Overview\n\nJanuary to December 2020\n\nPEOPLE IN NEED IN 2020 BY SEVERITY\n\nPeople in need in counties with low access constraints\n\npeople targeted\n\nof people in need\n\nPeople in need in counties with medium access constraints\n\npeople targeted\n\nof people in need\n\nPeople in need in counties with high access constraints\n\npeople targeted\n\nof people in need\n\nOut of the 7.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2020, approximately 254,000 people lived in the counties with high access constraints, including some 215,000 targeted with assistance.

Concerns were raised as to whether the so-called districts were in fact without cases. The first and second phase of the sample collection in the districts have been concluded; with 1,082 samples collected in 44 districts. WHO is currently working with health authorities to address the issue of a possible local transmission of the virus in districts with a positivity rate \u2265 5%.\n\nFLOODS UPDATE Humanitarian partners are responding to health needs of 107,900 people in flood affected regions, driven by displacement of population in Beletwayne, Jawhar, Balcad, Marka, Afgoye, Wanlawayn, and Baidoa and concerns over water-borne disease and other health threats including increased risk of COVID-19. A number of partners have been able to move services closer to the displaced population, others are facing funding challenges, ending several projects and limiting surge capacity to meet the increased case load.\n\nIn August Hagaa rain floods led to a new AWD/Cholera outbreak in Afgooye which partners are responding to by carrying out case management, prevention and control activities. WHO also\n\nsupported through case investigation for confirmatory test in the National Reference laboratory in\n\nMEASLES UPDATE The measles outbreak in Kismayo that began in August, with fifty-five (55) patients admitted at the Kismayo General Hospital over the course of 4 weeks, has in September increase to 130 cases and 0 deaths. WHO assessed the situation and with State MOH planned to do measles vaccination campaign integrated with vitamin A supplementation and deworming in October.

A large part of the AWD/Cholera cases are attributed to flooding outside of Banadir.\n\nWORLD HUMANITARIAN DAY: CELEBRATING HEALTH CARE WORKERS IN SOMALIA During the month of August, the Health Cluster in Somalia joined the rest of the world to celebrate health care workers who dedicate their time to bring healthcare closer to the population. Health care workers in Somalia are especially hailed considering the circumstances in which they provide their services, sometimes even putting their lives at risk in order to reach populations in high insecurity and rough terrain areas where health care access is limited.\n\nSomalia Humanitarian Fund Floods Response Allocation Health cluster partners benefited from the Somalia Humanitarian Funding (SHF) pool. The fund, totaling to $1,000,000 for both integrated and health specific response was tailored to respond to the floods situation in the country caused by the Gu seasonal rainfall. Areas targeted included Middle Shabelle and Balcad for health specific response, while Health and Nutrition integrated response targeted the population in Lower and Middle Shabelle regions that were most affected by the floods situation.

    "text": "32015\n\nRefugees and migrants with special protection needs such as persons with disabilities, survivors of gender-based violence (GBV), indigenous people and homeless people continue to be among the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related measures adopted by states. This manifests in increased levels of xenophobia, a shortage of adequate services, and a lack of awareness, sensitivity, and training with regards to providing such groups adequate services. Borders remain porous, causing complications for the identification and monitoring of human trafficking and smuggling cases, and limiting the provision of protection and assistance to those exploited and at risk of abuse.\n\nThe Regional Platform notes with concern the disproportionate social and economic impacts of the pandemic on young refugees and migrants from Venezuela. Due to the interruption of their education or vocational training, or the loss of employment and income opportunities, affected refugees and migrants from Venezuelans are at risk of long-term social decline. Among other effects, a recent report of the ILO stated that affected Venezuelans may face great difficulties in finding decent employment throughout their lives.\n\nDue to ongoing return movements of thousands of Venezuelan refugees and migrants to their home country, the Regional Platform hosted a technical workshop on returns on 5 June. More than 60 participants from various regional Sectors, National and Sub-regional Platforms, the donor community, as well as key R4V partners took stock of the current realities facing those who are returning and discussed the development of coherent responses by R4V actors and Platforms to support affected Venezuelans. Participants agreed that the health and protection risks, as well as long-term adverse impacts associated with these return movements can be mitigated through prioritized humanitarian and integration interventions that provide sustainable alternatives to returns.\n\nPlatforms\u2019 Response**\n\nIn Brazil, R4V partners are holding informative sessions in Pacaraima and Manaus on new movement restrictions and on COVID-19 prevention. The Warao radio community programme \u00b4Yakera Jokonae\u00b4 continued to disseminate prevention messages for the indigenous community living in shelters in Manaus. To ensure the constant availability of clean water, storage tanks have been installed and water trucking is operational in seven shelters in Boa Vista.\n\nWhile governments in the Caribbean are generally relaxing COVID-19 mitigation measures, landlords have become more rigorous in evicting tenants, disregarding government\u2019s pleas for leniency. As a result, emergency shelter assistance has become a priority for R4V partners of the Sub-regional Platform. In Guyana, travel restrictions are also contributing to\n\nirregular crossings, making it difficult to monitor and identify specific needs of Venezuelans in Guyana.\n\nIn Central America and Mexico, partners of the Sub-regional Platform continue to support refugees and migrants from Venezuela through food cards, mental health and psychosocial support, WASH assistance and GBV prevention in high risk\n\ncommunities with a greater proportion of migrants and refugees. Costa Rica has been increasing movement restrictions,\n\nwhile Panama is relaxing some and is authorizing domestic work, benefitting refugees and migrants who depend on this\n\nsector for income.\n\nR4V partners in Chile have been providing humanitarian assistance to refugees and migrants. R4V partners prepared a joint letter to the Government advocating for the inclusion of undocumented children and their parents in the Registro Social de Hogares (a national social protection net). Meanwhile, the national protection sector is strengthening its needs analysis and response activities.\n\nIn Colombia, the Grupo Interagencial para Flujos Migratorios Mixtos (GIFMM) is implementing the second phase of its Joint Needs Assessment. Over the last two weeks, 2,500 surveys were conducted via telephone in 25 departments by 29",

    "text": "30431\n\nThe Government of Costa Rica responded to COVID-19 with an emergency declara\ufffdon on 16 March, and several measures, including movement restric\ufffdons and closing of na\ufffdonal borders, which restrict entry to na\ufffdonals and residents. An addi\ufffdonal decree prohibits legal status holders from re-entering the country if they depart between 25 March and 12 April, and they lose their status if entering irregularly. The border rejec\ufffdons and subsequent responses may place refugees and migrants from Venezuala at risk. The Migra\ufffdon Authority provided a two-month extension of documenta\ufffdon for persons of concern and an online process for new work permits; In addi\ufffdon, no new asylum claims are being formalized (resul\ufffdng in a nearly 7-month wait for documenta\ufffdon), and no new interviews are being conducted (increasing the backlog of cases pending adjudica\ufffdon to 25,913 as of 31 Mar 2020). Those awai\ufffdng documenta\ufffdon do not have access to healthcare services, beyond life-saving emergencies or COVID-19; regular medical aten\ufffdon is a key need, par\ufffdcularly for those in high-risk categories. Social distancing protocols and other restric\ufffdons have resulted in many refugees and migrants from Venezuela losing their jobs, affec\ufffdng their livelihoods and ability to meet basic needs. As a result, food security and housing / shelter needs are growing rapidly by the day.\n\nIn Mexico, travel restric\ufffdons related to COVID-19 have caused the number of people trying to apply for asylum at Mexican airports to drop, including na\ufffdonals of Venezuela. A decrease of arrivals from refugees and migrants from Venezuela was no\ufffdced at the airports, however, accurate figures regarding arrivals are not available.\n\nThe Government of Panama declared a State of Na\ufffdonal Emergency to face the risk caused by COVID-19, taking a series of protec\ufffdon measures for all people in the country, including the closure of all borders, schools, stores, and imposing a curfew among other measures. This situa\ufffdon placed several opera\ufffdonal challenges and has affected the implementa\ufffdon of all ac\ufffdvi\ufffdes planned for this period. Asylum authori\ufffdes are s\ufffdll working with reduced staffing while interviews are rescheduled. No new applica\ufffdons are being received, but those who six months term for applying is about to expire, are being listed by the ONPAR so their applica\ufffdon will be formalized when possible. The Na\ufffdonal Immigra\ufffdon Service has taken measures in response to COVID-19, suspending aten\ufffdon to the public and all migratory procedures. Regarding to the documenta\ufffdon of residence permits (permanent, provisional and in process), there is an extension of their validity un\ufffdl the first week of April. Regarding work permits, the Ministry of Labor has taken similar measures, extending the validity of the cards un\ufffdl April 30th.\n\nCOSTA RICA\n\nMost R4V partners implemented strict teleworking policies due to the COVID-19 pandemic and are adap\ufffdng some ac\ufffdvi\ufffdes to social distancing protocols for example by providing services online and telephone. Virtual mee\ufffdngs with several stakeholders have been organized for reques\ufffdng addi\ufffdonal funding to enhance response mechanisms to beter protect vulnerable Venezuelans. Advocacy ac\ufffdons are ongoing for promo\ufffdng inclusion of venezuelans among govermental responses. As part of the strategic partnership between one of the partners and the Costa Rican Social Security en\ufffdty to provide 6,000 asylum- seekers with health insurance in 2020, more than 4,000 persons have met the criteria for insurance coverage. In March, 287 of these were from Venezuelan. Despite processing challenges caused by COVID-19 and subsequent related protocols, partners con\ufffdnues to remotely process 500 individulas per week and adapted inclusion criteria to ensure those in high -risk categories are included in the program.\n\nR4V partners implemented CBI throughout March, adop\ufffdng strict distribu\ufffdon procedures to reduce the risk of transmission. Concerning basic needs and essen\ufffdal services, 138 venezuelans where provided with some form of food asistance and 56 venezuelans received NFI.",

    "text": "34360\n\nFLASH UPDATE\n\nARGENTINA \u2013 COVID-19 17 July 2020 | Update #16\n\nKey Figures \u2022 185,711 persons of concern to UNHCR, including 3,881 refugees, 8,044 asylum-seekers, 443 others of concern, and 176,343 Venezuelans displaced abroad. Two Venezuelans were reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 in one of the most populated and poorest neighborhoods of Buenos Aires city. UNHCR partners are assisting them accordingly with shelter and food. \u2022 Funding: US$24 million are required by UNHCR for the operation in the sub-region (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay) in 2020, and it has only covered 37 per cent of the funds required for its operational needs. Funding is urgently needed to cover the most pressing humanitarian needs during the winter (shelter, food, hygiene kits, winter clothing and blankets) for the most vulnerable asylum-seekers, refugees, mainly Venezuelans displaced. While seeking funds to carry out COVID-19 preventive measures and response activities, UNHCR stresses the need for support to be in addition to the existing critical funding requirements laid out in UNHCR\u2019s regular Global Appeal for 2020. For the revised US$755 million appealed for UNHCR\u2019s operations in affected countries by COVID-19 until the end of the year, as part of UN inter-agency Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP), 36 per cent has been already funded or pledged, thanks to the generous and timely contributions of donors.\n\nSituational highlights \u2022 As of 17 July, Argentina reports 114,783 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,122 deaths. Argentina has also been selected as a testing ground for a new vaccine against COVID-19. \u2022 All staff in Argentina continue teleworking mode, complying with the sanitary restrictions imposed in the country. Partners continue providing remote assistance to asylum-seekers, refugees, Venezuelan displaced and others of concern in Buenos Aires, La Quiaca, Puerto Iguaz\u00fa, Posadas and San Salvador de Jujuy. \u2022 Argentina will gradually loosen a lockdown that has lasted nearly four months in and around Buenos Aires, President Alberto Fernandez said on 17 July, after tougher restrictions since the start of July helped slow the spread of new COVID-19 infections. The gradual return to normal life will happen in several stages, with the first stage lasting until 2 August. In most of Argentina\u2019s 23 provinces, except for greater Buenos Aires, community circulation of the virus is very low, and restrictions have generally been loosened in most regions, with more and more activities allowed to restart under specific conditions. Borders remain closed, though a ban on commercial flights is due to expire on 1 \u2022 The humanitarian impact of COVID-19 on asylum-seekers, refugees and Venezuelan displaced is disproportionate since most of them have lost their jobs and livelihoods in the informal market. Many of them have been confronted with a situation of being on the street without access to shelter, food and income to pay for their more basic needs. This precarious situation is exacerbated with the winter. They cannot access social programs due to lack of documentation and/or not complying with requirements related to the length of their residence in the country.\n\nUNHCR\u2019s response \u2022 Over the last three weeks, UNHCR partners provided advice to some 504 persons in Argentina, 321 of them who got in touch with partners for the first time during last week. \u2022 In Argentina, over the last three weeks, UNHCR partners provided with assistance in cash to some new 602 refugees and migrants. UNHCR also made a distribution of debit card for 60 refugees and migrants who had recently obtained savings accounts from the Banco Ciudad, providing them for the first time to have access to financial services in the country. \u2022 UNHCR continued to provide shelter to some 90-80 vulnerable refugees and migrants in Argentina over the last three weeks. \u2022 UNHCR through its partners is following up and helping a Venezuelan man in La Quiaca (border with Bolivia) who has been detained by the police after being returned from Bolivian territory, with the aim to return to Venezuela. \u2022 As a result of the national consultation held in Argentina for the preparation of the response for the socio-economic recovery of refugees and migrants in the COVID-19 emergency, a permanent roundtable (MACIRM for the Spanish acronym) has been set up to define both a model of coordination that is widely accepted across the government and line ministries and accountable national policies, ensuring effective delivery on refugee assistance, social protection and local integration. This mechanism is co-convened by the Ministry of Social Development and the Secretariat for Human Rights and counts with the participation of the National Commission for Refugees",

    "text": "55027\n\nUnited Nations Nations Unies Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\nUNDER-SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS AND EMERGENCY RELIEF COORDINATOR, MARK LOWCOCK Briefing to the Security Council on the humanitarian situation in Syria New York, 28 April 2021\n\nAs delivered\n\nThank you very much, Mr. President.\n\nI will cover five points today: first, COVID; second, the economic crisis; third, the protection of civilians; fourth, the issue of humanitarian access; and finally, assistance humanitarian organizations are providing across Syria.\n\nLet me start with COVID, which Geir [Pedersen, UN Special Envoy for Syria] said I would.\n\nAs I have said before, since testing across the country is so limited, there is a high degree of uncertainty over exactly the scale of the pandemic in Syria.\n\nBut from the available information, it is pretty clear that the virus spread is, again, rapid but also accelerating. The number of new cases recorded by the Ministry of Health in March was twice the number recorded in February.\n\nHospitals in Damascus, including intensive care units, are now full.\n\nIn northern Syria, new cases have been confirmed in displacement camps, including at al Hol and al Roj. Both those camps lack the resources to treat COVID patients.\n\nIn the UN, we are doing what we can to provide support, including by enhancing surveillance capacity, by providing PPE and by providing training for medical workers, as well as supporting the roll-out of vaccination campaigns.\n\nLast week, the first deliveries of vaccines from the COVAX facility arrived in Syria, and additional deliveries are expected throughout the year.\n\nThe supplies from COVAX should cover around 20 per cent of the population, but that\u2019s obviously not nearly enough. It is a vital first step to protect medical workers and those most vulnerable, but more vaccines will be needed as soon as possible.\n\nLet me just make the obvious point that the vaccine doses that reached north-west Syria were delivered, like all UN humanitarian assistance there, through the Bab al-Hawa border crossing. It is really not clear how future such deliveries could reach north-west Syria unless you confirm the re-authorization of UN cross-border access.\n\nAnd Geir has made an appeal to you today on that, reinforcing what the Secretary-General has already said. I, of course, endorse those appeals too. Next, Mr. President, is the economic crisis.\n\nThe exchange rate has again been volatile; in fact, it has appreciated over the last month or so. It is now around SYP3,400 to the US dollar on the informal market. That compares with SYP4,700 to the dollar at a low point in March.\n\nOne consequence of that is that there are, in some places, some reductions in prices, for staples like rice and sugar, many of which are imported, obviously. But food prices overall do remain at historically high levels. In fact, in Al Hassakeh, subsidized bread prices doubled this month.\n\nSo, across the country, our food security assessments still show the situation is getting worse.\n\nMost Syrian households \u2013 more than half of them \u2013 report not having sufficient, or sufficiently nutritious, food. That\u2019s an increase of more than 70 per cent compared to last year. And the proportion is \u2013 it won\u2019t surprise you \u2013 much higher among people who have been displaced or among returnees.\n\nOngoing fuel shortages are increasingly affecting humanitarian operations as well. Several field missions were cancelled this month because there wasn\u2019t enough fuel to conduct them.\n\nMr. President, my next point is protection.\n\nGeir touched again on the violence we have seen recently. Two more aid workers were killed in Syria this month. The two volunteers for the national NGO \u201cAl Bir and Al Ehsan Ras Al Ain\u201d were killed in an armed attack on 17 April on their way back from a humanitarian assistance project in Deir ez-Zor.\n\nI, again, condemn this and all similar attacks. Humanitarian workers in Syria deliver life-saving aid under the most challenging circumstances and at great personal risk. They really must be",

    "text": "54582\n\nWFP South Sudan Country Brief\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nOperational Context\n\nContact info: wfp.southsudan@wfp.org Country Director: Matthew Hollingworth\n\nFurther information: https://www1.wfp.org/countries/south-sudan\n\nPhoto Credit: WFP/ Marwa Awad\n\nIn Numbers\n\n14,756 mt of food and nutrition assistance distributed* USD 2.48 m in cash-based transfers made* USD 211.6 m six months (February \u2013 July 21) net funding requirements\n\n1.19 m people assisted* *in January 2021 Operational Updates\n\nWFP continues to provide assistance as a priority to populations living in IPC Phase 4 and Phase 5 risk counties. WFP delivered food assistance to 244,990 beneficiaries in IPC Phase 5 risk counties (Pibor, Akobo, Tonj North, Tonj South, Tonj East and Aweil South), and to 80,309 beneficiaries in IPC Phase 4 risk counties (Ayok, Duk, Twic East and Bor South).\n\nFlooding continues to negatively impact WFP\u2019s efforts to deliver food commodities in IPC priority counties such as, in Ayok, Duk, and Twic East. WFP has continued to explore alternate options to preposition and deliver food for the rest of year. One of these alternate options includes WFP\u2019s operation to patch the dyke parallel to the Baidit-Jalle-Maibor road, drain the flood water from this region and subsequently rehabilitate the Bor- Baidit-Jalle-Mabior road axis. This operation is critical to allow WFP to preposition over 60,000 mt of commodities before the start of the rainy season, in April/May, and improve the connectivity between Jonglei and the rest of the country.\n\nWFP, the Food Security Cluster and the humanitarian initiative REACH conducted a ten-day mission to Pibor Town, Gumuruk and Lekuangole from 9 to 19 February, to understand the scale of the humanitarian response in Pibor County. Visible malnutrition, adoption of extreme coping mechanisms and consistent reports of hunger related deaths from the communities suggest that the situation remains very severe. Considerable efforts to scale up humanitarian assistance are ongoing and provision of other forms of assistance, such as emergency water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health services, and other basic services in additional to food assistance are critical to reverting the current trends.\n\nFood and Nutrition\n\nIn Akobo WFP reached 74,205 beneficiaries with life-saving food assistance, representing 100 percent of the February target. In Aweil South WFP reached 27,608 beneficiaries with life-saving assistance, representing 100 percent of the February target. Furthermore, in Aweil South, consultative meetings at county and payam level for the targeting of an additional 24,000 beneficiaries, were completed, increasing the number of targeted people under the IPC scale-up response to 50,100. In Pibor two-month distributions covering food needs for February and March are currently ongoing. WFP have achieved 84 percent of their target in Gumuruk and achieved 10 percent in Lekuangole, thus far. In Tonj East, 15,000 people have received assistance through two-month distributions covering their food needs for January and February, representing 100 percent of the February target. With final assurances obtained from communities in Tonj East, WFP will start food distributions in March. In Tonj South and Tonj North, WFP provided food assistance to 50,000 and 25,000 beneficiaries, representing 100 percent of the February target. WFP reached 50,000 beneficiaries, representing 100 percent of the February target.\n\n\u2022 Provide nutrition-sensitive food assistance to crisis-affected\n\n\u2022 Provide food and nutrition assistance to refugees\n\n\u2022 Provide nutrition assistance to populations at risk of\n\n\u2022 Provide livelihood support and build the resilience of rural \u2022 Provision of infrastructure development services for humanitarian access and community\n\n\u2022 Operate Air Services for the Humanitarian Community \u2022 Coordinate the Logistics Cluster in Support of the Humanitarian Community \u2022 Supply Chain provision \u2022 Inter-Agency IT Communication Service \u2022 SCOPE Service to humanitarian partners \u2022 Provision of IT services to the humanitarian community \u2022 Provision of infrastructure development services Donors (listed alphabetically) * Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, European Commission, Finland, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia South Korea, South Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States of America",

During the reporting period, the situation in Hudaydah city was relatively calm owing to a pause in military operations. However, clashes intensified in At Tuhayat and Zabid districts of Hudaydah city in the second week of July and intermittent airstrikes and shelling continued in Sa\u2019ada and Taizz.\n\nThe protection of civilians continues to be threatened in Al Hudaydah by indiscriminate attacks, as fighting has spilled over into urban areas. According to the latest UN Refugee Agency-led (UNHCR) Civilian Impact Monitoring Project (CIMP) report, the number of civilian impact incidents in Al Hudaydah rose by 78 per cent (16 incidents) from 5-11 July, as the fighting entered more populated areas. Some 88 per cent of these incidents were recorded in the At Tuhayat and Zabid districts of the governorate, which resulted in 59 civilian casualties, double than that of the previous week. The incident with the largest potential protection implication occurred in At Tuhayat, where the main water tanks supplying the city were reportedly damaged, affecting as many as 14,424 households. The CIMP report also indicated that 50 per cent of the incidents were caused by airstrikes, followed by shelling.\n\nThe Head of UNHCR\u2019s Aden sub-office visited Kharaz Camp with the Governor of Lahj, Chief Security Lahj and Chief of the Security Belt on 5 July. UNHCR, in partnership with the Governor, inaugurated a water project in the village adjacent to the camp, to benefit host community members. In relation to the registration and documentation of all refugees residing in Lahj Governorate, the Governor expressed his support for the issuance of identification documents for refugees.\n\nA displaced family receives cash assistance in Aden. Photo: UNHCR\n\nIDP Response\n\nUNHCR continues to work closely with humanitarian partners to respond to the displacement from Al Hudaydah and surrounding areas. The Agency is delivering life-saving shelter and protection/referral services to displaced families at the Humanitarian Service Points (HSPs), Transit Sites and Collective Centres in Al Hudaydah city and other\n\nAs of 13 July, humanitarian partners have verified 35,000 displaced households from Al Hudaydah governorate since the offensive officially began on 13 June. Humanitarian partners have also supported some 20,000 of these displaced families with rapid response\n\nUNHCR, through partner Jeel Al Bena distributed CRIs to 2,274 displaced families and Enhanced Emergency Shelter Kits (EESK) to 1,146 families in Hudaydah city, Al Marawi'ah and Ad Durayhimi. In Ibb, UNHCR through the Yemen Women\u2019s Union (YWU), distributed CRIs to 94 families and to 86 families in At Ta'iziyah in Taizz. Further to this, UNHCR distributed kits consisting of solar lamps, sleeping mats, water buckets, and plastic sheets through Nahda Makers Organization (NMO) to 1,000 families displaced in the Al Khawkhah and Hays districts of Al Hudaydah as well as to 250 families in Aden. UNHCR through INTERSOS provided cash for rental subsidies to over 100 displaced families in Aden, Lahj and south Taizz. The CRIs and shelter support have offered the families critical household items and temporary shelter, until a longer-term solution can be found. With a large number of civilians fleeing Al Hudaydah to Sana\u2019a, UNHCR through its partners distributed CRIs to 761 families and EESKs to 135 families in Dhamar, Amran and Amanat Al Asimah, targeting the most vulnerable newly displaced families. On 11 July, UNHCR\u2019s partner ADRA in Sana\u2019a commenced distribution of rapid response packages to over 5,000 displaced families from Al Hudaydah who are now sheltering with host families or renting",

    "text": "9968\n\nAN OVERVIEW OF HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE AND CHALLENGES\n\n\u201cThe human cost of armed conflicts and violence lies not only in the fact that innocent lives are lost but that civilian families are uprooted, scattered and forced to experience a reality filled with so much uncertainty.\u201d\n\nEloi Fillion, Head of Delegation for the International Committee of the Red\n\nCross (ICRC) in Nigeria\n\nThe humanitarian landscape of Nigeria generally encapsulates the armed conflict in the North East, the communal violence in the states of the North Central and South South regions and the growing needs generated from the influx of Cameroon refugees into some communities of South South and North Central states.\n\nRegardless of the root causes of the armed conflict and violence in these areas, the fact remains that the humanitarian needs are ever increasing, while access and security guarantees required by humanitarian actors to respond to these needs are constantly challenged.\n\nThe armed conflict in the North East, now in its tenth year, still generate the most important humanitarian needs in the country. In between December 2018 and mid-February 2019, over 80,000 persons have been newly displaced and\n\nare trying to find succor in camps and host communities that are already overburdened by existing demands. The recent spike in the numbers has led to increased pressure on resources and infrastructure in Maiduguri town and other local government areas such as Monguno, Konduga and Jere. Food, essential household items, water, shelter, access to medical care and an environment where sanitation is easy to maintain remain the most pressing concerns for the displaced populations.\n\nWhile the ICRC has worked extensively in the North East over the last nine years to meet humanitarian needs, the armed conflict still poses a range of challenges especially in the areas of security and access. The abduction and murder of two of our midwives threatened an already fragile health care system of the North East and slowed down humanitarian response\n\nin key areas to people who needed it the most. The ICRC offers support to 15 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCs) in the North East, however, due to the high level of insecurity this year, 4 of the PHCs in the North East have been unable to establish a functional referral system.\n\nOther areas in Nigeria have also been affected by armed violence that lead to important humanitarian needs. To help affected people to cope with an upsurge of communal violence in the states of Taraba, Benue, Kaduna, Plateau and Nasarawa the ICRC carried out cash assistance, distributions of food or household items to 120,000 persons in the third quarter of the year\n\nCommunal violence coupled with violence from cult groups in the South South continues to create\n\nproblems of displacement and unemployment for community members. In addition, the influx of Cameroonians into communities of Cross Rivers state increased the complexity of the humanitarian situation in this area. The ICRC carried out several vocational training and capital assistance programs aimed at improving the resilience of community members and enhancing their ability to generate and sustain means of livelihoods.\n\nThe ICRC is a neutral, independent, impartial humanitarian actor that puts the people most affected by the conflict at the heart of its operations. We remain committed to ensuring that victims of armed conflict and violence are protected and rely heavily on the acceptance of all parties to the conflict for the fulfilment of its mandate. To this effect, the promotion of the principles of\n\nInternational human law and international human rights law among the various ranks of military and security personal was and remains an active engagement of the ICRC.\n\nWorking in partnership with the volunteers of the Nigerian Red Cross Society, the ICRC continues to ensure that those affected by armed conflict and violence are given the assistance, livelihood sustaining\n\nmaterials, knowledge and skills to ease their suffering and improve the quality of their lives overtime.",

The next report will be issued on or around 18/03/19.\n\nCategory 3 Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Beira, Mozambique\u2019s fourth largest city, on 14 March evening leaving Beira with no communications and power services.\n\nAn IT emergency specialist from WFP\u2019s Fast IT and Telecommunications Emergency Support Team (FITTEST) was deployed as ETC Coordinator on 15 March to conduct an initial Information and Communications Technology (ICT). The Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) has not been yet The Crisis Connectivity Charter has been activated and communications equipment is on the way to Mozambique from Dubai where the equipment was prepositioned.\n\nETC partners Ericsson Response, Government of Luxembourg and T\u00e9l\u00e9coms Sans Fronti\u00e8res (TSF) have mobilized personnel and equipment to Mozambique to help provide communications services.\n\nSituation Overview\n\nMozambique is among the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The occurrence of natural disasters such as floods, cyclones, drought and earthquakes frequently has a significant impact on its people and the economy.\n\nTropical Cyclone Idai - a category 3 cyclone - made landfall in Beira, Mozambique\u2019s fourth largest city, on 14 March evening, resulting in wind speeds of up to 224km/h and heavy rains. Cyclone Idai is the strongest tropical\n\ncyclone to affect Central and North Mozambique since Tropical Cyclone Eline which struck the country in\n\nFebruary 2000, claiming at least 800 lives.\n\nPage 1 of 4\n\nThe ETC is a global network of organizations that work together to provide shared communications services in humanitarian emergencies.\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nFollowing the cyclone, the ETC deployed a coordinator to assess the status of the communications services and infrastructure on the ground and start initial coordination amongst local and deployed humanitarian\n\nactors in support of lifesaving activities. The ETC Coordinator is currently travelling on an inter-agency\n\nmission to Beira and is expected to arrive on 18 March.\n\nTo augment the existing communications services in the affected areas if required, ETC partner the Government of Luxembourg mobilized 2x rapid deployment kits and 2x staff to provide Internet connectivity services. In addition, ETC partner Ericsson Response is deploying 1x staff and the WIDER solution to manage and distribute Internet connectivity. This equipment and personnel are expected to arrive in Maputo on 17\n\nA team of three people from ETC partner TSF has been deployed to Mozambique with connectivity equipment to provide services to humanitarian partners in the affected areas as needed. One of the team\n\nmembers and some of TSF\u2019s equipment are part of the inter-agency mission to Beira that left Maputo on\n\n16 March.\n\nThe Crisis Connectivity Charter has been activated in response to the Cyclone Idai. Communications equipment from signatories Eutelsat, Iridium and Irmasat was hand-carried by the ETC Coordinator to the\n\nPlanned Response\n\nOnce the ETC Coordinator arrives in Beira, a comprehensive assessment mission will be conducted across the affected areas to map the communications needs of the response community and possibly deploy shared communications services to facilitate the operation. The most appropriate location to set up the equipment from Ericsson Response and the Government of Luxembourg will be identified.\n\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) equipment and 1x expert are being deployed from WFP\u2019s Regional Bureau in Johannesburg to assist in inter-agency mapping activities in the affected areas.\n\nAs of 16 March, all domestic flights remain cancelled and access to affected areas in central and northern Mozambique remains a challenge. National carrier LAM is tentatively resuming operations on 17 March, depending on weather conditions. Beira is not accessible by road from Maputo as a flooded road is reported in Nhamatanda. UNHAS is setting up an operation to support humanitarian access to Beira.",

The first days after the cyclone were very critical due the torrential rains aggravating the situation and causing deadly floods.\n\nWhile the humanitarian response initially addressed the consequences related to one disaster, namely the cyclone, it is now a response to two disasters: the cyclone and the floods. This resulted in days of confusion, with difficulties in knowing the areas affected by one or the other. Indeed, the victims were not the same: the cyclone affected the most fragile homes in the exposed areas, while the floods affected any structures located in the areas at risk of flooding.\n\nGeography makes the affected areas very difficult to access, and the demographic distribution spread over such a zone of intervention makes the prioritization of needs very difficult: most of the people affected were living in Beira, the main city, but higher mortality rates are affecting less populated areas around Beira.\n\nHumanitarian Needs\n\nT\u00e9l\u00e9coms Sans Fronti\u00e8res 19, rue Jean-Baptiste Carreau, 64000, Pau - France +33 5 59 84 43 60 www.tsfi.org - @TSF_Intl\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\n25th March 2019\n\nOn the night between 14 and 15 March 2019, Cyclone Idai hit Mozambique's coasts causing very strong gusts of wind and torrential rains in the provinces of Zambezia, Sofala, Manica and Inhambane. The cyclone made landfall on the coast of Beira, the fourth largest city in the country. 1.6 million people could be affected by its impact. Following the landfall of the cyclone, the city of Beira was flooded and telecom networks were seriously damaged. There is still no electricity and while the telephone and internet networks are being restored, telecommunications are still unstable.\n\nIdai hit the coast at Category 3 (Cyclone Tropical Intense), with wind gusts reaching 200 km/h and a storm surge between 3 and 5m. According to several experts, this cyclone would be the most powerful hitting Mozambique since Eline in February 2000.\n\nAt the beginning of March, floods caused by the early cyclone Idai had already affected more than 140,000 people, caused 66 deaths, 11 injuries and forced more than 17,000 people to abandon their homes in Zambezia and Tete provinces. The affected area is particularly important for the country. About 40% of Mozambique's population lives on the coast and 25% of the gross national product is generated in this region.\n\nTSF deployment Deployment date \u2013 15/03/2019\n\nWhile Cyclone Idai made landfall on the night of Thursday 14th March, TSF deployed a team at the same time from HQ in France to support relief efforts and assist the affected population.\n\nOur team brings satellite equipment to reconnect relief actors to the Internet and provides telephony service for the affected populations to help them contact their loved ones. The team arrived in Maputo on 16th March, being able to access Beira, one of the most affected areas, on 17th of March.\n\nSince the beginning of the mission, coordination is probably the most critical point for organizing humanitarian aid. The centralization of humanitarian aid in Beira is essential to reach the affected areas, but faces logistical challenges: no road access to the city, airport initially closed, damaged electricity network, missing means of communication.\n\nThe establishment of the Internet is vital in raising awareness of the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the two meteorological phenomena.\n\nInternet connection has been immediately provided as since then to the hundreds of humanitarian actors that are assisting the populations in this emergency, proving the important need of this service in order for them to carry out their activities.\n\nFurthermore, on 20th March, the team also has started to provide telephony services for the population in different locations of Beira, where people have been relocated from the different affected areas of the city and surroundings.",

    "text": "44628\n\nGiven the existing vulnerability of the South Sudanese population and the persisting information gaps, an evidence-based identification of regions prone to COVID-19 outbreaks is urgently needed to inform a targeted humanitarian response. To support an evidence- based response to both the COVID-19 pandemic as well as ongoing humanitarian needs, this factsheet provides an overview of existing multi-sectoral vulnerabilities in the 19 counties prioritised for response (see vulnerability matrix below) to inform humanitarian actors on the risks related to a COVID-19 outbreak and prepare affected populations in vulnerable hard- to-reach communities. Indicators related to Health, Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Protection, and Food Security and Livelihoods (FSL) have been assessed to map the situation in these counties as of March 2020. The Rumor Tracking overview1 provides a qualitative assessment of rumours across the country related to sources and transmission of COVID-19, symptoms, prevention and treatment, as well as the government and humanitarian response. This factsheet is intended to compliment in-depth State and sector analysis, as part of the monthly sector factsheets, and quarterly HSM State Situation Overviews.\n\nVulnerability Matrix\n\nIn collaboration with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the Needs Analysis Working Group (NAWG), REACH supported a risk analysis aimed at identifying the counties in South Sudan at the highest risk of COVID-19 entry and spread, and the counties with populations with high intersectoral vulnerabilities, that are likely to experience more serious COVID-19 disease outcomes. Composite indicators were constructed for each of these indices using available data sources, and scores were calculated for each county.\n\nFor \u2018Risk of COVID-19 entry and spread\u2019: a combination of flow monitoring data (IOM, UNHCR, REACH), COVID-19 caseloads in neighbouring countries (UNICEF), population density (OCHA COD-PS, FSNMS, GHSL), and the presence of IDP/Refugee populations were used. Counties were scored on a scale from 0-12. For \u2018Intersectoral Vulnerabilities\u2019: a combination of population density, elderly demographic data (FSNMS), food insecurity and acute malnutrition projections (IPC), access to soap and water (FSNMS), access to healthcare (FSNMS), and proxy indicators for the level of infectious and chronic disease (IDSR, FSNMS), were used. Counties were scored on a scale from 0-25. The following 19 priority counties were chosen based on high scores in both \u2018risk of entry and spread\u2019 and \u2018intersectoral vulnerability\u2019 indices.\n\nMap 1: Prioritised counties for COVID-19 Response\n\nFlagged county State boundary County boundary\n\n1. The Rumour Tracking Overview can be found on page 2. For following pages: 2. A protected/improved waterpoint includes: boreholes, protected wells, tapstands, donkey carts, water kiosks and piped systems. Unprotected waterpoints are significantly more likely to be exposed to contaminants (animals, faeces, rainwater etc). 3. NC refers to 'no-consensus', which is assigned to responses when several Key Informant Surveys from the same settlement are triangulated and there is not agreement on one indicator. 4. Source: IPC - Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, Projection 1 February-April 2020 5. Food consumption coping strategies are methods adopted by households to increase existing food stocks such as reducing the number of meals, reducing food sizes, prioritising children eating in the household before adults, and skipping entire days without food.\n\nKey Trends\n\n\u2022 A number of key trends have emerged in community perceptions of the virus across South Sudan. In all assessed locations, there was a disparity between how respondents understood the severity of the virus, and the likelihood they would contract it. This disparity was especially pronounced in early May, as social distancing measures were relaxed across the country (despite an uptick in confirmed cases), leading to rumours that the virus was eradicated and did not pose a continued threat.",

    "text": "42786\n\nGIEWS Country Brief Burkina Faso\n\nReference Date: 23-October-2020\n\nBelow-average cereal output expected in 2020 due to climate events and persistent insecurity\n\nHarvesting operations of the 2020 main season crops are underway for rice, millet, maize and sorghum crops across the the country. Abundant rains allowed a timely start of planting activities in May in the south and west (Banfora, Bobo Dioulasso, Gaoua districts) and in May/June in the north. Precipitation amounts were above average in most areas since May, favouring crop germination, establishment and development as well as improving vegetation conditions. In addition, the Government supported farmers by providing improved seeds, fertilizers, pesticides as well as services of land use planning.\n\nHowever, in September, below-average rainfall and moisture deficits had a negative impact on the main season cereals in the southwestern part of the country. This situation will likely to result in a reduction of income through the declining opportunity of labour and the sale of production surpluses, increasing the food insecurity in these areas. Moreover, periods of heavy rains resulted in localized flooding in August and September across North Central Region, Kaya and Ouagadougou districts, causing human casualties, loss of livelihoods and damage to crops, livestock and infrastructures. This will likely reduce crop yields in lowland areas across the country. Futhermore, the widespread high levels of the conflict in the Sahel and North Central regions, coupled with and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, limit the access to land and agricultural inputs, disrupting agricultural activities. In addition, localized Fall Armyworm (FAW) and desert locust outbreaks were reported, especially in South-West, Cascades and Hauts Bassins regions. Overall, 2020 cereal crop production is estimated at below the last five-year average.\n\nSeasonal rains since July 2020 increased the quantity and quality of pastures and allowed the repleneshiment of surface water to satisfactory levels, improving livestock body conditions and\n\nenhancing animal market value in most parts of the country. However, in the Sahel and Center-North regions, animals' access to natural resources is often limited by persistent insecurity, armed and community conflicts, theft and banditry. In accessible areas, high livestock concentration are observed, ensuing rapid degradation of fodder and water resource and leading to an early start of the lean pastoral lean season. The animal health situation is overall stable, with only some outbreaks of seasonal contagious epizootic diseases including Contagious Bovine Peripneumonia (CBPP), anthrax diseases, pasteurellosis, poultry diseases and Peste de Petits Ruminants.\n\nAbove-average harvest gathered in 2019, except in conflict-affected zones\n\nFavourable rainfall in 2019 benefitted crop development in most parts of the country. The national cereal production in 2019 is estimated at an above-average level of 5 million tonnes. However, production shortfalls were recorded in several areas due to a late onset of the rains, pockets of drought in September, excessive moisture conditions in October and some attacks by birds on crops in the Eastern and Western regions. Similarly, in conflict-affected areas, most households have been unable to cultivate or have abandoned their fields due to increased security incidents, leading to a below-average production in these areas.\n\nDespite the above-average cereal production in 2019, import requirements for the 2019/20 marketing year (November/October) are expected at a sligthly above-average level due to strong demand by local traders aiming at replenishing their stocks.\n\nPrices of coarse grains generally stable, but rising in conflict-affected areas\n\nPrices of coarse grains were stable at high levels between August and September 2020. This situation is explained by seasonally tight market availabilities, exacerbated by institutional purchases to support IDPs, the strong import demand by the Niger and the increased transportation costs due to poor road conditions during the rainy season. In particular, very high prices of grains are reported in the areas with a strong presence of IDPs, including the provinces of Djibo, Dori, Namounou and Diapaga due to the impact of the persistent insecurity situation.",

The initiative is guided by the CWG Markets Taskforce, led by REACH and supported by the CWG members. It is funded by OFDA and UNHCR.\n\nMarkets in key urban areas across Libya are assessed on a monthly basis. In each location, field teams record prices and availability of basic food and non-food items (NFI) sold in local shops and markets.\n\nThis factsheet presents an overview of price ranges and medians for key food items and NFIs in the assessed areas, as well as the costs associated with key elements of the Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB).\n\n\u2022 Field staff familiar with the local market conditions identified shops representative of the general price level in their respective locations.\n\n\u2022 At least four prices per assessed item were collected within each location.

    "text": "51576\n\nAFGHANISTAN Seasonal Monitor Dec 3, 2020 Above-average mid-November precipitation facilitated winter wheat planting\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n\nWell-distributed precipitation around mid-November reduced the precipitation deficits prevailing from the beginning of the 2020/21 wet season in the country. Average cumulative precipitation conditions are currently observed across the country.\n\nSnow depth is generally above average in the northern, northeastern, eastern, and central highland basins, but below average at higher elevations in the northeastern\n\nBelow-average precipitation and above-average temperatures are expected due to La Ni\u00f1a conditions through the end of March 2021. Overall, the northern wheat belt may be stressed by reduced water availability and increased water demand during the 2021 season.\n\nThe Global Forecast System (GFS) 7-day total precipitation forecast indicates a 50 percent chance of 25 mm precipitation or more in the central and northeast in the week ending December 8 and a 30-40 percent chance of 25 mm precipitation or more in the northeast during the week ending December 15.\n\nRecent mid-November precipitation and that anticipated in the coming two weeks are expected to create favorable conditions for normal completion of winter wheat planting. However, it is important to note that colder temperatures may freeze the soils and make them more difficult for planting in December.\n\nFigure 1: October 1 \u2013 November 25, 2020 cumulative precipitation anomaly relative to the average of 1981-2010\n\nData: CHIRPS version 2.0 prelim., Source:USGS/UCSB Figure 2: Snow depth difference anomaly relative to the average of 2002-2016 in mm as of December 1\n\nUPDATE ON SEASONAL PROGRESS\n\nPrecipitation anomalies: Source: USGS/NASA Cumulative precipitation from October 1 through November 10 was significantly below normal over Afghanistan. However, mid-November precipitation across most of the country erased the above deficits; as of November 25, average cumulative precipitation conditions are seen across the country (Figure 1). It is reported that the mid-November precipitation has been beneficial to farmers who had already planted wheat, while farmers who had not yet started cultivation are reported to be waiting for the soil to become drier before proceeding with regular planting operations.\n\nFEWS NET Afghanistan\n\nFEWS NET is a USAID-funded activity. The content of this report does not necessarily reflect the view of the United States Agency for International Development or the United States Government.\n\nAFGHANISTAN Seasonal Monitor\n\nDec 3, 2020\n\nSnowpack and snow water volume:\n\nGood precipitation around mid-November has led to positive snow accumulation in the lower elevations of the country's eastern, central, central highland, northern, and\n\nnortheastern basins. On the other hand, negative snow depth\n\nanomalies are seen at higher elevations in the Kokcha_Ab-i- Rustaq and Panj basins as of December 1 (Figure 2). An initial spike in the snow water volumes is seen in the basins that had received mid-November precipitation. On the other hand, snow water storages are yet to show an increase in Farah\n\nAdraskan, Khash Khuspas, and Arghandab basins.\n\nFigure 3. The Global Forecast System 7-day forecast, probability of precipitation exceeding 25 mm for the period ending December 8\n\nAccording to the Global Forecast System (GFS) 7-day total precipitation forecast, there is up to 50 percent chance of 25 mm precipitation or more in the central and northeast in the week ending December 8 (Figure 3). Further, the GFS 14-day total precipitation forecast also indicates a 30-40 percent probability of 25mm precipitation or more in the northeast during the week ending December 15. The above anticipated precipitation will benefit wheat cultivation in areas where it was delayed and complete wheat planting in time.\n\nThere may be wide-ranging consequences of the below- average cumulative precipitation expected due to La Ni\u00f1a, including: below-average snow accumulation, reduced snow water volumes and runoff, lower water availability for winter and spring wheat from March through May because of deficient and uneven distribution of spring rains, below- average wheat production, reduced water availability for second crop cultivation from July through September, and over-reliance on groundwater.",

    "text": "57042\n\nThe report is produced by OCHA DRC in collaboration with humanitarian partners. It covers the period of 31 May 20211, until 4pm (Goma time).\n\nMore than 232,400 displaced persons in Sake, Rutshuru, Lubero, Minova and Bukavu\n\n35 suspected cases of cholera in the health zone of Kirotshe\n\nFood assistance to displaced people is underway\n\n1,361 unaccompanied children as a result of the volcanic eruption, including 858 children who have already been reunited\n\nWater assistance remains\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nThe Goma Volcano Observatory (OVG) announced on 31 May that the possibility of an eruption on land or under the lake has not been ruled out and recommended that the population stay away from lava flows. The provincial authorities of North Kivu also asked the population to remain vigilant, and to strictly follow the measures adopted. The tremors are less noticeable, however, the Rwanda Seismic Monitor recorded a tremor of magnitude 4.2 on 30 May at 11.13pm.\n\nThe national Minister of Transport, Communication and Opening up announced on 30 May that conditions for the reopening of air traffic at Kavumu airport in Bukavu are satisfactory. Goma airport remains closed and under surveillance.\n\nSome banks that have not been operational since 27 May in the city of Goma have reopened and are now offering a minimum service to their clients.\n\nIn coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), UNICEF is also supporting the rehabilitation of the water network in Goma.\n\nFollowing the Nyiragongo volcano eruption, 1,361 unaccompanied children have been identified by UNICEF in coordination with the Division of Social Affairs, the DRC Red Cross and the NGO Change the World. 858 children have already been reunited with their families, while 332 are living with host families and in temporary host centres.\n\nThe information is collected from the partners on an ongoing basis, the data is therefore subject to change.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nDRC Situation Report. 7 | 2\n\nAs of 31 May, local authorities report the following numbers of displaced persons:\n\nNumber of IDPs (31/05/2021)\n\nMulti-sectoral response activities are currently underway in the Kirotshe health zone, and humanitarian partners continue to strengthen their response. Interventions to provide food assistance to displaced people are underway.\n\nUNHCR has strengthened the protection monitoring mechanism in the area. The NGO INTERSOS referred 11 unaccompanied children to the organization War Child for care.\n\nThe nutrition cluster noted the high vulnerability of unaccompanied children as well as pregnant and lactating women in the area. It recommended activating and promoting infant and young child feeding activities. The nutrition cluster also recommended paying attention to the care of cases of malnutrition within the functional health structures.\n\nWith the support of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), the Sake referral health center offers free care to populations but are at risk of being quickly overloaded. According to the nurse in charge of this facility, medical consultations have increased from 25 to more than 300 per day since the arrival of the displaced. It is necessary for humanitarian actors working in the health sector to support other health centers with inputs, particularly for the people displaced following the Nyiragongo volcano eruption. According to the Zone Chief Physician (MCZ), the priority are the health centers Kaduki, Shasha, Kihindo, Bweremana, Nzulo and the general reference hospital of Kirotshe.\n\nAccording to the MCZ of Kirotshe, 35 suspected cholera cases have been identified in the Kirotshe health zone. UNICEF has noted a rapid increase in suspected cases since 29 May in the health areas, recording 18 suspected cases in two days. Faced with the movement of people between Goma and Sake, humanitarian actors are mobilizing to prevent a new outbreak in the region. UNICEF has set up 10 water points and installed 12 chlorination points in Sake. Another 55 manual chlorination points have been installed on the Sake-Minova axis.",

The scale up plan includes 8.2 million people who will receive in-kind food assistance, 2.8 million who will receive commodity vouchers and eventually a further one million people to will benefit from receiving cash- based transfers.\n\nFood assistance has played a critical role in preventing Yemen slipping into famine. The current scale up is in response to increased needs caused by the ongoing conflict and exacerbated an economic decline that has resulted in food prices 66-162 percent higher than before the crisis. About 20.1 million people are food insecure, an astonishing two-thirds of the population and an increase of 13 per cent from 2018.\n\nA mother feeding her children in an IDP camp in Lahj Governorate. Photo: Giles Clarke/OCHA\n\nNearly 10 million people are suffering from extreme hunger and close to 240,000 people are experiencing catastrophic food consumption gaps. An estimated 7.4 million people require services to treat or prevent malnutrition, including 3.2 million people who require treatment for acute malnutrition \u2013 2 million children under 5 and more than one million pregnant and breastfeeding women.\n\nCurrently, the people of Yemen are more vulnerable and hungrier than at any time since the escalation of\n\nthe conflict in March 2015. Overall, 230 out Yemen\u2019s 333 districts are at risk of famine. An estimated 18.5 million people live in these districts, including 7.1 mil- lion who need life-saving food and livelihoods assis- tance, 6.6 million who need WASH support and nearly 8 million who need healthcare. With two-thirds of the population food insecure, Yemen is the world\u2019s largest food security crisis.\n\nThe severity of food security in various governorates. Source: IPC HUMANITARIAN PARTNERS CONTINUE TO PROVIDE RAPID RESPONSE ASSISTANCE TO IDPS IN AL HUDAYDAH\n\nHumanitarian partners continue to provide assistance across Al Hudaydah Hub area amid expectations that hundreds of thousands of displaced people may return to the governorate, if the situation continues to\n\nAs of 16 January 2019, Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) partners in Al Hudaydah Hub identified 110,294 displaced families mostly, from Al Hudaydah Governorate, and hosted in various districts in the four governorates in the hub (Al Hudaydah, Hajjah, Raymah and Mahwit). Of these families, 105,846 were provided with RRM assistance. These include 38,269 families who received multi-purpose cash transfers; 26,526 families who received non-food item (NFI) packages, and 12,385 families who received emergency shelter kits (ESKs) in Al Hudaydah and Hajjah governorates.\n\nWorking with an implementing partner, WFP began a food distribution in At Tuhayat District, a district which had previously been unreachable. As of 16 January, 506,315 metric tons of food supplies had been distributed to 2,671 families.\n\nOn 25 January WFP suffered a setback when a fire at the Red Sea Mills in Al Hudaydah City damaged wheat in two silos. WFP has 51,000 metric tons of wheat stored at these mills, a quarter of its in-country wheat stock and enough to feed 3.7 million people for a month. WFP has been unable to access the mills since September 2018 because of fighting.\n\nIn Hajjah Governorate, escalating hostilities and civilian casualties continue to be reported particularly in Hayran and Mustaba districts as well as near Haradh Town. In the first three weeks of January at least 300 families were displaced to Abs District and to Haradh town, where living conditions are dire. Partners are providing assistance across the governorate.\n\nOver the last two months, the civilian toll in Hajjah has risen significantly. On 26 January, a collective centre for IDPs was shelled in Haradh District, killing 8 people and wounding 30 others. The collective centre is located near an area where 6 children and 2 women were killed in another incident on 11 January. Hospitals and other public service providers in Haradh, the most affected district, have closed due to",

The Venezuelan popula#on, mainly residing in urban se1ngs, is moving towards the interior of the country due to the limited economic opportuni#es in Panama City, and the high cost of living. A considerable percentage of cases contacted during the protec#on monitoring reported that they have changed their residence to the Province of Panam\u00e1 Oeste, Province of Herrera and Province of Veraguas, which are mainly rural se1ngs.\n\nA report published by the Organiza#on of American States (OAS) noted Costa Rica\u00b4s efforts to maintain an open border policy for Venezuelans, such as accep#ng expired passports. The report1 also highlights that Venezuelans who arrived in Costa Rica during the last five years face greater vulnerability than those who arrived between 2010 and 2014. To produce the report, experts visited the country and met with various groups to understand their situa#on in Costa Rica, confirming that most venezuelans flee from widespread violence, disrup#on of public order, and viola#on of human rights. The report states it is essen#al to create the bases for a regional consensus that grants refugee status to Venezuelans according to the Cartagena Declara#on, as expressed by the OAS working group for this topic in a June 2019 regional report. The report also calls to speed up crea#on of a complementary protec#on pathway and encourages foreign donors to provide assistance \u2013 be it financial or technical.\n\nIn January 2020 UNHCR Costa Rica announced that refugees and asylum seekers could request medical insurance at their main offices. This insurance program is being founded by UNHCR (La Naci\u00f3n, 2020).\n\nIn Mexico, January started with a total of 52,982 permanent and temporary residents, students and humanitarian visa holders (as of 31st December 2019) and 18,501 Asylum applicants2. Partners in MX informed that obtaining accurate figures of Venezuelans applying for asylum in Mexican airports remains a challenge.\n\nIn Panama with the aim of reducing the risks of Gender-based violence (GBV) among refugees, asylum seekers and vulnerable migrants, partners organized a community-based ac#vity for providing informa#on regarding preven#on and response to GBV. A total of 17 Venezuelan women had ac#vely par#cipated in this event. Furthermore, to con#nue suppor#ng access to asylum in Panama, one of the partners provided legal orienta#on at the premises of the Na#onal Refugees Office (ONPAR). A total of 15 Venezuelans (10 women and 5 men) were provided with legal orienta#on.\n\nDuring the repor#ng period, a R4V partner in Panama through the Employment Centre, provided access to computers and laptops for refugees and migrants to write resumes, for ensuring access to employment web plaKorms and access to different courses through Coursera plaKorm. On January 24 Venezuelan (13 women and 11 men) had access to this service.\n\nIn addi#on, Cash-based interven#on con#nues in Panama, as one of the partners delivered mul#purpose cash for educa#onal inclusion and medical aLen#on to 168 people (90 women and 78 men). In the provinces of Panama and Panama Oeste, one of the partners provided 32 Food Coupons, reaching 86 beneficiaries (33 women, 27 men, and 26 children), allowing the beneficiaries to\n\nFull report is available in OAS webpage hLps://www.oas.org/documents/spa/press/informe-migrantes-venezolanos-en-Costa-Rica.pdf\n\nIns#tuto Nacional de Migraci\u00f3n/Direcci\u00f3n General de Regulaci\u00f3n y Archivo Migratorio (2020), \"Flujo migratorio de nacionales de Venezuela\", con datos del Sistema\n\nde Integraci\u00f3n y Procesamiento de Informaci\u00f3n Migratoria (SIPIM), con base en los registros administra#vos del Sistema Integral de Operaci\u00f3n Migratoria (SIOM).

The WFP consignment included 10 MT of Immediate Response Ration (IRR) kits\u2013 a specialized kits of ready to eat food for one week and 4.5 MT of High Energy Biscuits. WHO shipped 30 MT of medical supplies which were handed over to local health authorities. The inter-cluster assessment team that visited Qalansya District confirmed the critical need for WASH, food, non-food items and health interventions. Needs, however, stem from pre-existing vulnerabilities as no major impact resulted from the cyclone, except for limited damage to infrastructure. On 1 June, the inter-cluster assessment team visited Nowgd area (115 Kms South of Hadibo). Astero, Badehola and Zahiq (located in the southern part of the island) are the most affected locations that the team was able to visit. It is estimated that in these areas 90 per cent of the population are in need for food and WASH assistance and some 1,500 families require shelter and non-food items.\n\nCurrently, there is no stock of wheat flour and sugar and only low quantities of rice and other critical commodities. As of 4 June, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has brought in 70 MT of food ration, 500 tents, 3,000 blankets and 1,000 carpets. Kuwait relief agencies including the Kuwait Red Crescent have so far brought in 20 MT of food ration and on-food items. The situation in Al Mahara Governorate, which was also hit by Cyclone \u201cMekunu\u201d appears to have stabilised although some areas are still flooded. Agricultural equipment and warehouses were damaged in Al Ghaydah. ICRC reports 20 persons injured and four dead (two in Hawf and two in Al Ghaydah). The roads in and between Hadramaut and Al Maharah Governorates are reportedly partly damaged or blocked by floods, rocks or quicksand.\n\nAccording to the Governor\u2019s office, Socotra might be at risk of hunger unless immediate resources are mobilized to cover the food stock gap created as result of the cyclone. Seven ships carrying food stock for the period of monsoon reportedly sank with the food consignment onboard. In few weeks, sailing across sea will not be possible due to the strong winds and the island will be only accessible via the airport.\n\nRelief flight in Socotra. Photo: UNOCHA\n\nINTENSIVE FIGHTING APPROACHES AL HUDAYDAH CITY AMID FEARS OF INCREASED HUMANITARIAN IMPACT\n\nHeavy fighting continued along Yemen\u2019s western coast during the reporting period, localised displacement is being reported with communities moving to nearby areas during clashes and returning home after the violence has subsided. Humanitarian partners are concerned that as the fighting draws closer to more populated areas, including Al Hudaydah City, the humanitarian impact of the conflict will increase, particularly in terms of\n\nThere are reports of mines being laid in areas of conflict, which would have a long-term impact on local communities. Preparedness measures such as prepositioning of relief supplies in key locations is underway to ensure timely assistance to the populations who may be affected by the fighting.\n\nUPDATES FROM THE HUBS\n\nSa\u2019ada: Nutrition cluster partners are looking into ways to scale up the response to Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and other nutrition related activities in eight priority districts in Sa\u2019ada Governorate and 12 priority districts in Al Jawf Governorate. In the latter, the Nutrition Cluster will activate MAM and SAM treatment in 12 health facilities and seven mobile clinics.\n\nFollowing heavy rains on 2 June, floods in the districts of Al Maton, Al Hazm, Az Zahir, Al Matammah and Al Humaydat in Al Jawf Governorate have reportedly damaged houses, farms, water wells, and roads. A total of 326 households have reportedly been affected by the floods among them 66 displaced families in Al Maton District. A local partner of WFP and UNICEF is conducting a rapid assessment of needs in the affected districts. With more rains and floods reported, the number of affected population is expected to increase.",

They requested IMC to provide COVID-19 response. The population of two cities are in dire need of emergency WASH services including COVID19-awareness messages and providing information on hygiene practices to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 for 3,520 most vulnerable families in Mazar e Sharif and 1000 families in Maimana Cities\n\nThis assessment was conducted by IMC WASH team in close coordination with Balkh PRRD, DoRR in Mazar e sharif and Maimana cities. Need assessment findings revealed that a total of 4,520 IDPs/Returnees families are living, Therefore, IMC proposed hygiene promotion with the following recommendations.\n\nKey Recommendations and proposed activities Include: 1. COVID -19 Awareness 2. Distribution of Consumable Hygiene Kits 2. Hygiene Promotion at Household level and community level\n\nTargeted Beneficiaries: According to IMC assessment report outcomes, the following below categories are in extreme need of COVID-19 response in Mazar e Sharif, Balkh and Maimana cities.\n\nPage 1 of 2\n\nAt the outset of the report, over 95% of all respondents were not aware of COVID-19 and 100% aren\u2019t attributed to mass messaging campaigns from government and non-government actors.\n\nGraph Analysis: The chart shows significant differences in regard to provision of hygiene promotion,1: zero% indicates none of the families received hygiene Promotion, 2: Hygiene kits zero % shows that out of the total populations none received any kind of consumable hygiene kits from any agency yet, 3: out of total only 5% families are having information about COVID-19.\n\nWASH needs assessment was coordinated with all WASH interagency WASH Cluster Coordinator Balkh MoRR, Provincial Rural Rehabilitation Directorate (PRRD) and with local community leaders in the area. Continuous coordination will continue with all relevant sectors and stakeholders during implementation of this project.\n\nPage 2 of 2",

    "text": "63221\n\n@WFP/Jessica Lawson\n\nImpact of low water levels in the Euphrates on local markets\n\nThe Euphrates river enters Syria in Jarabulus (Aleppo) and flows through the governorates of Aleppo, Ar-Raqqa and Deir-Ez-Zor for a total distance of 604 km, before reaching the Iraqi border in Al-Bukamal. The two main dams of Tishren and Tabka form two consecutive lakes, with the largest one being Lake Assad, covering a total area of 525 km2. The population in the Euphrates basin is heavily dependent on the river for drinking water and agri- culture. Moreover, the dams are the only source for electricity, given that alternative power stations have been damaged. Additionally, the water ca- nals starting from Lake Assad irrigate agricultural areas as far as the eastern outskirts of the city of Aleppo. The surface level of the Euphrates River in and around Lake Assad in June 2021 have decreased compared to June 2020 and June 2008, noting that 2007-2008 saw one of the worst droughts in Syria that was mainly driven by below average precipitation rather than hydrological causes (i.e. river water levels). The causes for the reduced water in the dams and water flow in the Euphrates river in 2021 is linked to reduced precipitation as well as reduced amounts of water flowing from Turkey into Syria. The reduced water in the Euphrates is directly affecting agricultural crop production in the region and as a result their prices3.\n\nImpact on retail prices of vegetables\n\nThe decrease in water levels in the Euphrates negatively affected the production of vegetables alongside the river, and therefore the availability of main vegetables decreased espe- cially in Eastern Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor. The power cuts also\n\naffected small farmers in Northeast Syria who mainly depend\n\non electricity for irrigation.\n\nThe production of vegetables between June and July of each year usually increases, and the prices of these items decrease; however, this was not the case this year due to the reduced production of vegetables. The closure of cross-line points be- tween the Kurdish areas and government-held areas was also\n\na reason leading to the reduced supply since many food com-\n\nmodities such as fruits and vegetables arrive in the Northeast Syria region from Aleppo and Syria\u2019s coastal region.\n\nThe main vegetables cultivated along the river are tomatoes and eggplants. Planting of vegetables starts in April and their harvest is typically between June and August of each year, leading to a reduction in local prices for these commodities. Nevertheless, this year, the decrease in prices was not as no- ticeable as usual due to the drier than average year and espe- cially due to the low water levels in the Euphrates river. Power\n\ncuts have also reduced the amount of water used for crop\n\nOn average in Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor, when looking at the decrease percentage in prices between April (the beginning of\n\nplanting period) and June (the beginning of harvest season),\n\ntomatoes\u2019 price decreased by 38 percent in 2021 compared to 62 percent during the same period (April to June) over the past three-year-average price (2018 to 2020).\n\nSimilarly, the price of eggplants decreased by 46 percent be- tween April (the beginning of planting period) and June (the beginning of harvest season) in 2021 compared to 57 percent during the same period (April to June) of the past three-year-\n\naverage price (2018 to 2020).\n\nMap 2: Northeast Syria markets by the Euphrates river Chart 2: Retail vegetables prices in Northeast Syria, SYP\n\nSource: WFP\n\nOn average in Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor, the price of tomatoes reached SYP 788/kg in June 2021, increasing in price by 348 percent compared to the past three-year-average price for June. Moreover, the price of eggplants reached SYP 824/kg in June 2021, increasing in price by 417 percent com- pared to the past three-year-average price for June.\n\nStaple cereals retail prices\n\nWheat Flour\n\nM-o-m, the national average retail price of wheat flour throughout Syria de- creased by three percent, reaching SYP 1,870/kg, while y-o-y, the wheat flour price increased by 99 percent. As-Sweida recorded the highest wheat flour price in June at SYP 2,198/kg (down three percent m-o-m), while Idleb recorded the lowest price of SYP 1,488/kg (up two percent m-o-m).",

Cameroon ranks now as the eleventh country in Africa with the highest number of confirmed cases after South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Algeria, Ghana, Libya, Kenya and Tunisia. Less than three weeks ago, Cameroon was the ninth most affected country regarding total number of positive cases.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.

No new cases of contamination have been recorded among health workers and pregnant women from 1 to 14 October. Regrettably, fourteen new positives cases among health staff arose within the week from 15 to 29 October, in the Littoral, South and East regions bringing the cumulative number of positive cases among health personnel to 877, with no new death. Strategies to roll back the spread of the virus in sensitive places, such as hospitals or maternity wards shall be sustained. Contrary to the seemingly descending epidemiological curve observed in other regions, the number of positive cases is increasing in the Far-North region with 608 positive cases, including twelve deaths, as of 21 October 2020. This worrying situation calls health actors to increase vigilance and monitoring of the epidemiologic in the coming weeks.\n\nOn 15 October 2020, the Minister of Health launched the COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys. These surveys will be conducted from October to December 2020 in the ten regions of the country with the support of partner health NGOs, WHO and UNICEF. The objective of the surveys is to estimate the prevalence of the virus\u2019 antibodies in adults and children older than five years. It will also determine the risk factors by comparing exposure and assessing knowledge and attitudes related to COVID-19. These surveys will take place in public places (bus stations, markets, places of large gatherings, etc.).\n\nINTER-AGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nAll humanitarian partners, including donors and recipient agencies, are encouraged to inform OCHA's Financial Tracking Service (FTS - http://fts.unocha.org) of cash and in-kind contributions by e-mailing: fts@un.org",

Specific information about UNHCR\u2019s response to COVID-19 in DRC can be found here.\n\nIn May, 534 Burundian refugees and 234 Rwandan refugees who decided to return to their countries of origin were assisted by UNHCR and the National Commission for Refugees (CNR) and repatriated in safety and dignity.\n\nUNHCR and its partner War Child Holland supported the Burundian Refugee Sexual and Gender-Based violence (SGBV) committee with awareness raising activities and messaging related to the elevated risks of SGBV in the context of COVID-19. A total of 617 Burundian refugees (129 in Lusenda camp and 488 in Mulongwe settlement) were reached. Messages addressed intimate partner violence, early or forced marriage and denial of resources.\n\nAs of 31 May 2021, UNHCR and the National Commission for Refugees (CNR) have biometrically registered 26 new arrivals from South Soudan including 09 men and 17 women in Bele site. 50 family composition attestations were distributed to beneficiaries as part of the ongoing registration exercise in Bele. During the month under review, 104 protection incidents were reported and documented in the Faradje territory (Haut U\u00e9l\u00e9 Province) and in Aru territory (Ituri Province) by UNHCR partners, representing a 65% increase from April 2021, with the majority of the incidents committed by government forces and non-state armed groups.\n\nwww.unhcr.org 1\n\nOPERATIONAL UPDATE > DR Congo / May 2021\n\n9 sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) incidents were reported in Meri, Bele and Biringi sites during the month of May. The incidents involved rape, early/ forced marriage, denial of resources and opportunity and psychological violence. All survivors received psychosocial counseling by UNHCR and its partners; the rape survivors were also assisted through medical assistance, while mediation sessions were conducted for the survivors of early marriage and denial of resources and opportunities.\n\n1,718 refugee children between 0-11 months benefited from vaccination for the routine vaccines in the health centers of Biringi, Bele and Meri sites. These children had not yet been vaccinated due to a lack of vaccine stocks in the concerned sites.\n\nOn May 12 and 18, UNHCR partner AIDES organized two sessions offering psychosocial support for 200 persons living with HIV, including 170 refugees and 30 members of the host community in Biringi, Bele and Meri sites (Haut U\u00e9l\u00e9 Province).\n\nWATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE (WASH)\n\nUNHCR and partners continue to promote health and hygiene of Burundian refugees. During the month of May, 428 refugees were informed by UNHCR through a door-to-door awareness-raising campaign conducted on respecting hand hygiene measures before entering refugee camps and sites. Meanwhile, chlorinated water has been made available at the various entry points in Lusenda camp and Mulongwe\n\n1,445 persons, among which 609 in Meri and 836 in Biringi sites in Haut U\u00e9l\u00e9 Province were informed on hygiene and sanitation measures through a campaign conducted around the theme \"Living in a healthy\n\nSHELTER AND CORE RELIEF ITEMS (CRIs)\n\nIn the Mulongwe settlement (South Kivu Province) UNHCR through its implementing partner ADES distributed latrine kits consisting, as well as cash for shelter to 34 households (204 people) who were relocated in\n\nDuring the month under review, UNHCR and partner ADSSE distributed core relief items (CRIs) comprising blankets, sleeping mats, mosquito nets, buckets and jerry cans to a total of 10,385 (2,077 households) Central African refugees in Zongo, Sambolola and Congo-Rive localities, in South Ubangi Province. These distributions were meant to improve living conditions among the newly arrived Central African refugees whom, until now, have been living in makeshift shelters with no or limited access to essential services.\n\nIn Ndu, Bas U\u00e9l\u00e9 Province, UNHCR and ADSSE have distributed tarpaulins to 5,153 individuals (1,332 households) including host community members, whose shelters had been destroyed by strong winds and torrential rains earlier during the month. A similar assistance is planned for other localities in South Ubangi which have also been heavily affected by the rainy season.",

    "text": "51258\n\nJonglei and Greater Pibor Administrative Area as of 8 December 2020 Humanitarian Update\n\n\u2022 Large-scale inter-communal and sub-national violence, mainly during the dry season, and massive flooding during the rainy season have displaced hundreds of thousands of people in Jonglei and Greater Pibor Administrative Area (GPAA) in 2019 and 2020. These recurrent shocks have created new humanitarian needs, in addition to those planned for in the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), which targets some 1 million people in the area.\n\n\u2022 More than 100 humanitarian organizations have operated in Jonglei during 2020. Half of them are national NGOs.\n\n\u2022 Conflict, insecurity, flooding and COVID-19 restrictions have severely impacted humanitarian organizations\u2019 ability to reach the most vulnerable people with much-needed assistance. Of the nine humanitarian workers killed in 2020, eight lost their lives in Jonglei and GPAA. All were South Sudanese.\n\n\u2022 It is highly likely that sub-national conflict and flooding will occur again in Jonglei and GPAA in 2021 and lead to further displacement and\n\nHUMANITARIAN SITUATION\n\nSuccessive cycles of inter-communal violence and seasonal flooding are not new to Jonglei and GPAA, however, both have intensified in the last few years. As a result of the violence and flooding, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, increasing their vulnerability and acute humanitarian needs. In 2020, the people in Jonglei and GPAA were first affected by four waves of large-scale, organized violence during the dry season in the first half of the year. Inter-communal violence and revenge attacks at the sub-national level displaced an estimated 157,000 people in the Bor South, Duk, Nyirol, Twic East and Uror counties and GPAA. Then, an\n\nestimated 387,000 people in Jonglei and another 141,000 people in GPAA were affected by floods during the rainy season from May to December 2020.\n\nPeople affected were already acutely food insecure, with many in Crisis and Emergency levels of food insecurity (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, Phases 3 and 4 respectively). According to the IPC analysis published in early 2020, people living in the subsequently flood-affected counties were in IPC Phase 4 with the exception of Bor South and Twic West who were in IPC Phase 3.\n\nJonglei and Greater Pibor Administrative Area Humanitarian Update\n\nas of 8 December 2020\n\nAs a result of the violence, humanitarian staff had to relocate. Organizations\u2019 ability to respond to people\u2019s needs was greatly reduced, especially in GPAA, with only small-scale teams left in\n\nSeven years of recurrent conflict, floods and resulting displacement have led to protracted and increasing vulnerability of communities living in Jonglei and GPAA, compounded by frequent disruptions to\n\nhumanitarian services to people. Access to the labour market as well as reliance on coping mechanisms, such as collection of wild food and construction materials, charcoal production and hunting, were constrained by movement restrictions due to floods, insecurity and COVID-19. This has affected the income and resource levels of many people.\n\nConflict and flood-affected people by county as of November 2020\n\npeople affected people affected in 387K 141K\n\nHUMANITARIAN ACCESS An upsurge in violence severely impacted humanitarian operations in Jonglei in February 2020. Local authorities advised humanitarian organizations to limit their activities beyond Pibor town. The main supply route from Bor to Pibor was cut off due to insecurity during much of the dry season and later due to the poor road conditions during the rainy season. Looting of supplies during the violence was common and a major setback to the humanitarian response. Around 20 looting incidents have been recorded since February with many humanitarian facilities and infrastructure damaged or destroyed in Gumuruk, Likaungole, Manyabol and Pieri, among others. The rise in insecurity led to the relocation of nearly 150 aid workers from Jonglei, impacting the ability of humanitarian organizations",

Between 13 and 16\n\nDecember, 48 new cases have been reported: all but two in N\u2019Djamena (46), the rest in Mayo-Kebbi Est (2). The nineteen cases reported this week in N\u2019Djamena are from prospective travelers, taking a required test in anticipation of their trips. In the Logone oriental province, where a cluster of cases had been detected in the refugee camps of Dosseye and Belom (Nya Pende department), all reported cases have now recovered according to UNHCR\u2019s monitoring of the situation. Awareness-raising activities have been reinforced in the\n\ncamps, while respecting barrier measures. While still urging caution, the Chadian Government has exceptionally decided to relax the current curfew across the country on Christmas eve (the night of 24 December), allowing movement that evening until 1am, instead of the regular times of 9pm (in N\u2019Djamena) or 7pm in some (WHO situational reports and UNHCR)\n\nINTERCOMMUNAL CONFLICT\n\nOuadda\u00ef, Batha, Tandjil\u00e9 Series of deadly conflicts between communities across country: On 12 December, in the locality of Achiguek\n\n(Batha province) a conflict between two communities resulted in 25 deaths. The Minister of Territorial Administration, Ismael Chaibo, travelled to the area the following day and stated: \u201cThis is not an intercommunal\n\nconflict; it is a territory issue between two communities\u201d. Weapons and motorcycles were seized by the authorities and security and defence forces were deployed in the area. Several incidents occurred in different parts of the country around the same dates. On 10 December, in Doulbarit, 45 kms from Abeche (Ouadda\u00ef province), media reported an incident between farmers and herders resulting in at least eight dead and 11 wounded. On 13 December, in the locality of Darengdje (Tandjil\u00e9 province), a conflict between farmers and herders resulted in at least three deaths. Last month, on 23 November, in Mayo-Kebbi est province, a conflict between herders and farmers is reported to have resulted in 22 dead, 34 wounded and 66 arrests. In reaction to the surge in deadly conflicts, the Government has ordered the reactivation of disarmament commissions in the country, charged with retrieving all illegally obtained weapons from civilians. The Government also announced a series of urgent measures to mitigate the situation, including strengthening awareness and prevention around the root causes of these conflicts, identifying all individuals or authorities\n\nimplicated in the conflicts, and strengthening control over cross-border circulation of firearms with neighboring\n\ncountries.

    "text": "1248\n\nUPDATE FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS\n\nAden: Humanitarian partners report an increased number of IDPs fleeing conflict from Al Khawkhah and Hays districts in Al Hudaydah Governorate towards southern governorates. According to preliminary information received, only 40,000 people remain in Hays district out of a total population of 67,000 people. An estimated 3,000 people remain displaced across several locations in the districts of Al Khawkhah and Hays in Al Hudaydah Governorate and in Al Mukha district in Taizz Governorate. In Hays and Al Khawkhah districts, the humanitarian response is challenging due to insecurity along the road with convoys exposed to indiscriminate shelling and the risk of landmines. An attempt by the Ministry of Health to deliver 15 tons of medicines was not successful because of insecurity.\n\nIn Shabwah Governorate, a new influx of IDPs from Nati\u2019 district has been reported. OCHA is following up with the clusters to assess needs and facilitate the response.\n\nAl Hudaydah: Displacement from active conflict areas continues to various locations within the Governorate. During the reporting period, local authorities reported that 426 newly displaced families have fled to Al Garrahi district and Al Hudaydah city, increasing the total number of the displaced to 3,628 families. Efforts are underway by partners to respond to the needs of the displaced families hosted across nine districts within the Governorate. WFP has completed the distribution of assistance to 529 displaced families in Zabid and Al Hudaydah city. Shelter partners have assisted 265 displaced families in Almansouriyah and Jabal Ras districts with shelter kits and NFI packages while 600 families in Al Garrahi district have been provided with hygiene\n\nLocal authorities in Al Hudaydah Governorate have requested the humanitarian community to support the establishment of an IDP camp to be located in Al Garrahi district to accommodate the\n\nnewly displaced families. Dialogue with the authorities on the issue is ongoing.\n\nIbb: Food distribution inside Taizz city has resumed after an agreement was reached between humanitarian partners and local authorities on beneficiary lists. The food vouchers distribution is still ongoing in both Al-Mudhaffar and Al-Qahirah districts with no incidents or obstacles reported. As of the first week of March, humanitarian partners have distributed 26,250 food baskets out of a total of 53,740.\n\nAn inter-cluster assessment mission to Al Mukha and Dhubab districts in Taizz Governorate has found that 10 out of 14 health facilities are not functioning. Supported by the Emirates Red Crescent, Al Mukha rural hospital is the only health facility providing primary health care in both assessed districts. However, it is barely functioning due to lack of medical staff and supplies and lack of secondary health services. WFP has started a general food distribution for 5,000 new IDPs and more partners are planning to expand their response. On 5 March, the employees of the Department of Education in Taizz received their salaries for the month of January 2018. The education sub-cluster reports that many children have left schools in Ibb governorate, after their families were unable to pay the 1,000 YER contribution requested by their schools as a compensation for the teachers who have not received their salaries for several months.\n\nSa\u2019ada: A visit to Al Jaheen spontaneous settlement in Raydah district in Amran Governorate by the shelter cluster has identified approximately 80 IDP households living in dire humanitarian conditions. The majority of these families, who are mainly from Sa\u2019ada Governorate, have been displaced for three years. The site is located on a water stream which gets flooded during the rainy season. The site has no latrines or a waste disposal system. It was also found that IDPs in the site have not received food assistance for more\n\nthan a year. IDPs reported facing the threat of being evicted due to their inability to pay rent. The shelter cluster has discussed the situation with the local authorities and is seeking to mobilize cluster partners to respond.",

    "text": "45931\n\nCOVID-19 cases are still on the rise across Syria, a trend likely to further worsen during the colder winter months. As of 30 November 2020, 7,887 cases of COVID-19 were officially confirmed by the Minister of Health in government-held areas in Syria, including 417 fatali-\n\nties, marking a 39 percent increase compared to the national rate of COVID-19 cases at the end of October. In addition, a partial lockdown has been imposed on all Kurdish-controlled areas in northeast Syria following the recent surge of COVID-19 cases in November, including a full lockdown on the town of Al-Malikia in Al-Hasakeh governorate. Furthermore, the COVID-19 outbreak continued spreading rapidly in opposition-held areas in northwest Syria, reaching around 15,502 cases of COVID-19 by the end of November. Repre- senting a three-fold increase compared to the announced rate of COVID-19 cases in northwest Syria at the end of October. The recent increase in COVID-19 cases has fueled increased concern across the country, given that most of announced cases have not been linked to exposure with a suspected source, pointing to large-scale community transmission.\n\nThe value of the Syrian pound continued to weaken in the informal exchange rate market and reached a monthly average of SYP 2,638/USD in November 2020, depreciating by 11 percent month-on-month. This is the first time the Syrian pound has reached this monthly national average level in 2020, outpacing the peak recorded in June (SYP 2,505/USD), suggesting an upward pressure on prices, including food.\n\nIntensified hostilities were reported in northwest Syria in November, especially south of the M4 highway and around the M5 highway, including artillery shelling across Ariha and Idleb districts. Such incidents of violence are impacting aid workers and temporary sus- pending humanitarian operations in northwest Syria, leaving the vulnerable population without food assistance. Additionally, rainfall during November caused widespread damage to IDP sites across northwest Syria, resulting in flooding and destruction of tents, which has affected more than 334 households in IDP sites across Idleb and western Aleppo. Also, the Islamic State continued to mount suicide attacks in Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor, highlighting a volatile security situation across northeast Syria.\n\nAfter more than nine years of conflict in Syria, which has caused extensive casualties, destruction of infrastructure and population displacement (more than half of its pre-war Syrian population has been forced to flee their homes, including more than 5.5 million have become refugees as estimated by the United Nations), the Syrian government hosted an international Russia-backed conference in Damascus in November 2020, aimed at finding ways to facilitate Syrian refugee returns to the country, despite reservations by the inter- national community on safe return conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, to address the pressing needs which flared-up from the dire humanitarian situation in Syria, WFP continued dispatching general food assistance, reaching around 4.7 million people in November across the country. WFP has sufficient stocks of ready-to-eat rations in place to respond should the situation further deteriorate. Furthermore, on 25 November, WFP finalized the delivery and installation of two generator sets in public bakeries in Dar'a. This was under WFP's Farm-to-Bread-concept to restore the bread supply chain to food insecure population and contribute to social cohesion in vulnerable areas.\n\nSources: Syrian Arab Republic: Recent Development Report No.21 | November 2020, COVID-19 Response Tracking Dashboard | Northwest Syria\n\nThis mVAM bulletin is based on data collected via live telephone interviews in November 2020 from households in locations across Syria. The phone numbers were generated using random-digit dial- ing. In November 2020, data was collected from a sample of 1,026 respondents across 13 governorates. Note that, from October 2020, the recall period of COVID-19 questions has been changed to be over the past 30 days instead of start of pandemic (24 March 2020). As per standard survey procedures, respondents\u2019 consent was ob- tained prior to the interviews. For security and safety measures, all respondents were identified with an anonymous ID.",

    "text": "56437\n\n4.6 million people assisted April 2021 (based on dispatches)\n\nWFP Syria Interim Country Strategic Plan (ICSP)\n\nContact info: Lauren LePage (lauren.lepage@wfp.org) Country Director: Sean O\u2019Brien Further information: www1.wfp.org/countries/syrian-arab-republic Photo: A beneficiary from southern rural Aleppo with WFP food assistance. \u00a9WFP/ Zuha Akkash\n\nSituation Update\n\nEconomic situation \u2022 The economic situation in Syria continued to deteriorate in April. The Central Bank of Syria on 15 April officially devalued the Syrian pound (SYP) from SYP 1,256 to SYP 2,512 to the US dollar. This is the first official devaluation of the Syrian pound since July 2020.\n\nThe value of the Syrian pound on the informal market stabilized somewhat in April at around SYP 3,000/USD 1, after dipping to a record low of SYP 4,700/USD 1 in mid- March. However, any potential impact of the currency value stabilization on food prices is yet to be seen. WFP continues to monitor food prices in markets across all areas of Syria on a monthly basis.\n\nFood Security Situation\n\n\u2022 The food security situation in Syria remains at critical levels, according to the latest WFP mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (mVAM) data from April 201. While the national average rate of inadequate food consumption (poor and borderline combined) decreased Page | 1\n\nby 16 percent from March to April 2021, it remains almost 50 percent higher than the national average level recorded in April 2020. More than two out of five interviewed households in Syria (43 percent) reported poor food consumption in April 2021, more than double the level recorded in April 2020.\n\nThe monthly decrease in inadequate food consumption levels in April is likely due to the observance of the holy month of Ramadan when families\u2019 access to food improves as the community and charities increase their assistance to vulnerable families.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n\nApproximately 60,082 COVID-19 cases and 2,770 deaths have been confirmed across all areas of Syria as of the end of April. This includes 22,513 cases and 1,572 deaths in government-controlled areas, 21,896 cases and 641 deaths in north-western Syria, and 15,673 cases and 557 deaths in north-eastern Syria.\n\nThe first batch of 203,000 AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine doses arrived in Damascus on 22 April. This first batch, allocated to Syria from the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX), will be allocated to frontline health workers, including health workers in north-eastern Syria. In coordination with GAVI (The Vaccine Alliance), the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) are providing technical assistance to Syrian authorities in preparation to launch the national vaccination campaign. Simultaneously, a separate batch of 53,800 doses for north-western Syria has been shipped through the WHO and UNICEF offices in Gaziantep, Turkey.\n\nNorth-Western Syria\n\nThe security situation in north-western Syria remained volatile in April, with fighting between government forces and non-state armed groups continued from multiple areas of southern Idlib and northe western Aleppo governorates. In anticipation of the 10 July expiry of the Security Council resolution which authorizes cross-border operations, WFP in April started the pre-positioning of food rations. WFP plans to pre-position up to three months of stocks.\n\nNorth-eastern Syria \u2022 On 20 April, clashes broke out in multiple neighborhoods of Qamishli city (Al-Hasakeh governorate) between the pro-government National Defense Forces (NDF) militia and Kurdish Internal Security Forces (ISF, also known as the Asayish). The clashes reportedly broke out following the arrest of an NDF commander by the ISF and lasted for several days until a ceasefire agreement came into effect on 24 April. According to the agreement, the NDF left the Tai neighborhood of Qamishli city (which was heavily impacted by the clashes) leaving it under the control of the\n\nFollowing the fighting, WFP\u2019s cooperating partner reported the displacement of 15-20,000 people from Qamishli city to several villages in the rural Qamishli area. In response, WFP on 24 April initiated an immediate response through its cooperating partners, providing General Food Assistance (GFA) rations sufficient for 8,500 people. Distributions for the remaining IDPs will continue over the month of May. Other UN agencies, including UNHCR, have distributed NFI and WASH items.",

    "text": "31580\n\nUPDATE No 3\n\nSITUATION/CONTEXT INFORMATION . On 26 March, President Vizcarra extended the state of emergency and the quarantine period until 12 April following the recommendations of health specialists and of the different sectors battling against the spread of the virus. On 26 March, the President requested extraordinary legislative powers to the parliament for a 60-day period. If approved, the executive will be able to legislate on what is deemed needed to safeguard the right to health, livelihoods and security. The Ministry of Health (MINSA) has been testing suspicious cases of COVID-19 among refugees and migrants living in shelters. All tested negative. On 26 March, Police entered a shelter in Lima and detained refugees and migrants after allegedly neighbours complained about the noise and the overcrowded space. With the support of GTRM partners they were released in the afternoon. \u2022 Partners are working with the MINSA to include some 100 Venezuelan doctors and health professionals to support the response.\n\nBORDER SITUATION .\n\n\u2022 Previously to the COVID-19 emergency, the President declared that all persons entering the country irregularly would be expelled. Under the current situation, and despite the Superintendence of Migration (SNM) overturning any order to expel foreigners, the Police continues to detain irregular entries without a clear protocol as to how to handle these cases and how to proceed.\n\nKEY IMPACTS, NEEDS AND RISKS .\n\nShelters require urgent food, WASH and management support to ensure compliance with governmental emergency sanitary policies, such as specif spaces to isolate potential or confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n\nWhile during the quarantine the executive decree allows mobility to supermarkets, pharmacies, hospitals (for emergencies) and banks within the area of residence, this mobility is conditioned by certain rules, including presenting a valid ID if requested by authorities. Asylum seekers ID is not a valid document to obtain free passage, and persons that have lost their documentation or have an irregular status cannot access these services if needed.\n\nAccording to the RMRP 2020 over 200,000 refugees and migrants are at heightened vulnerability risk for lack of shelter and food security. This situation is worsened by the current situation, including the extension of the mandatory social isolation, which prevents refugees and migrants who make their daily earnings working as street vendors.\n\nRESPONSE . Coordination activities continue to take place: GTRM Protection WG (25.03.20)\n\n1. Partners are improving emergency referral pathways for gender-based violence (GBV) and child protection in coordination with the Ministry of Women and Vulnerabe Populations (MIMP) .\n\nOPERATIONAL MEASURES 1. Previously to the President\u2019s request for extraordinary legislative powers, the Ministry of Justice coordinated with GTRM partners on topics in support of refugees and migrants\u2019 access to health, protection of vulnerable groups, and labour rights. 2. GTRM partners are coordinating with local health authorities in Lima (DIRESA) to ensure refugees and migrants living with HIV, pregnant women and those with existing health conditions access health services and reproductive health needs. 3. Between 16 and 25 March, partners assisted some 2000 refugees and migrants through hotlines. These services allow the GTRM to identify highly vulnerable cases, referring them to available CBI support. 4. On 25 March, a Venezuelan family was found living in a truck in Lima. The pregnant woman and her two other children were supported by partners, in coordination with authorities, and relocated to a hotel. The mother received medical assistance and the baby was born on 26 March. 5. In coordination with the National Food Bank, GTRM partners distributed 1,300 chickens to shelters and other spaces supporting refugees, migrants and host community in Lima. 6. More than 260 vulnerable families have been assisted with CBI support since 20 March. 7. Partners are in discussions with banking institutions to improve the conditions and limitations for CBI assistance. BBVA money transfers via telephone allowed refugees and migrants to withdraw money at the cashiers without the need of a card. However, the previous transfer limitations meant that one account could only do seven transfers in a monthly period. Through these discussions BBVA extended the limitations of transfers allowing partners to support more vulnerable families. 8. Over 340 persons in shelters in Lima, Tumbes and Tacna have received food provisions, hygiene and prevention orientation on COVID-19. In addition, in shelters in Tumbes, pregnant women are constantly monitored with prenatal check-ups. 9. In the first 10 days of quarantine almost 42,000 persons were reached through the Veninformado platform and social media.",

Reports estimate that 600,000 people in Sofala, Zambezia, Tete, Niassa, Manica and Inhambane provinces have been\n\naffected and are in need of humanitarian assistance. So far 150 people are reported dead (including 66 due to flooding before the cyclone impact) and more than 1,500 injured, with the toll expected to increase in the coming days. Prior cyclone-related flooding had already displaced 17,000 people and very likely thousands more were displaced after the\n\ncyclone passage. Houses, health, and education facilities have been severely damaged in the provinces affected, particularly in and around Beira. Extensive damage to livestock and planted crops has also been reported.\n\nBriefing note \u2013 19 March 2019\n\nSource: OCHA 17/03/2019\n\nAny questions? Please contact our senior analyst, Jude Sweeney: js@acaps.org\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nCrisis impact\n\nTropical Cyclone Idai - a Category 3 cyclone - made landfall on the city of Beira, Sofala province, over 14-15 March, with maximum sustained winds of 210 km/h, decreasing to 70 km/h while moving through Sofala and Manica provinces, towards Zimbabwe. Ninety percent of the city has been damaged or destroyed. The most affected provinces are Sofala, Manica, Zambezia, Inhambane and Tete. (Logistics Cluster 17/03/2019) Estimates indicate 600,000 people have been affected by the cyclone and need humanitarian assistance. (ECHO 18/03/2019) The full impact of the cyclone is not yet clear because of damage on roads and on the communications infrastructure; however, many parts of Beira and other districts are severely damaged. (IFRC 16/03/2019) The death toll stands at 150 people dead and more than 1,500 people injured. (ECHO 19/03/2019) The figure is likely to increase as search and rescue teams gain access to affected areas. Heavy rains are expected until 21 of March, with further risk of flooding in the affected areas. (Logistics Cluster 19/03/2019)\n\nIn the days prior to the cyclone\u2019s landfall, severe flooding related to the approaching cyclone had already impacted several districts in Sofala, Zambezia and Tete provinces, affecting over 140,000 people. Some 66 people died and more than 100 were injured as a result of the flooding. At least 17,000 people have been displaced by the floods and are sheltering in 15 transit centres. The flood-affected population have likely been additionally affected by the cyclone(OCHA 15/03/2019) (Club of Mozambique 15/03/2019).\n\nShelter: More than 12,000 houses have been destroyed by flooding since 9 March in Zambezia and Tete. People evacuated and displaced due to loss of property are being hosted in 15 transit centres in Tete and Zambezia. (OCHA 12/03/2019) There is no report on the current shelter situation situation of the population displaced. The impact of Cyclone Idai on shelters is still unknown. It is likely that thousands of homes will be damaged or destroyed.\n\nFood and livelihoods: Extensive destruction of livestock and planted crops has been reported, with 168,000 hectares of crops destroyed in Zambezia and Tete\n\ndue to flooding and cyclone impact. (UN News 15/03/2019)\n\nAs this happened before\n\nthe main harvest season, food insecurity in the region will be highly affected. Nampula, Tete and Niassa were among the worst affected areas by drought, also reporting high levels of food insecurity. Food distribution is being provided by local and international organisations. Needs assessment of the population in isolated areas is not available, mainly due to access constraints. In Beira city markets and businesses are not functional, no report on impact on trade, although it is likely the disruption of imports will further impact the food situation.\n\nACAPS Briefing Note: Tropical Cyclone Idai, Mozambique\n\nHealth: The emergency room of the Central Hospital in Beira is non-operational due to extensive damage, while other parts of the hospital were flooded but reportedly functioning. (OCHA 18/03/2019) Local and international media also reported that 18 hospitals have been destroyed by the cyclone (Al Jazeera 14/03/2019; Club of Mozambique",

Even without the wide-ranging impacts of Covid-19, forced evictions undermine efforts to help marginalised and vulnerable people escape\n\npoverty and secure durable solutions to their displacement. As such, forced evictions can be both a cause and a multiplier of displacement across the region.\n\nA forced eviction is understood as the removal against their will of people from their homes\n\nCovid-19 and its accompanying government\n\nrestrictions and economic impacts makes the threat of evictions across the East Africa region more complicated \u2013 and more pressing. People are finding themselves evicted at a time when there are unprecedented pressures on livelihoods and limitations on movement within and between cities.\n\nWhat little coping mechanisms vulnerable communities have, are being further undermined by Covid-19.\n\nand/or land which they occupy, without any form of For example, in Somalia, evictions represent a legal or other protection. In most cases evictions constant risk for vulnerable communities, including are unlawful and violate a range of civil, cultural, displaced populations living in collective economic and social rights enshrined in settlements and other urban poor in densely international and national laws. Yet evictions also populated areas. In 2019, more than 260,000 expose people to various forms of exploitation and people were forcibly evicted from their homes, disrupt livelihoods. Added to which, the destruction including over 150,000 in Mogadishu alone. And of property and assets by authorities or landowners while the numbers have reduced this year, 64,621 which often accompanies eviction, further weakens people have already been evicted in 2020, the resilience and coping mechanisms of including 33,400 in Mogadishu.1 communities, who already have limited capacity,\n\nresources and social capital.\n\n1 Norwegian Refugee Council, (NRC) Eviction Dashboard also found here:\n\nIn Ethiopia, in April 2020, municipal authorities in Addis Ababa demolished dozens of homes deemed\n\nto be illegally constructed on land with contested ownership, leaving approximately 1,000 people homeless. The houses belonged to day labourers, many of whom had lost their jobs due to the\n\nongoing Covid-19 lockdown.\n\nIn Kenya, in April 2020, authorities defied court\n\norders and forcibly evicted more than 7,000 people from land in Kairobangi and Ruai informal settlements in Nairobi.2 The official reason given\n\nwas that they demolished the homes because they were built on public land, the state-run Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NSWSC) claims ownership of the land and says the families had\n\nbeen occupying it illegally since 2008.\n\nIn South Sudan, evictions represent a constant risk for many communities \u2013 including internally displaced people (IDPs) living in abandoned or unused buildings.3 The Housing Land and Property Technical Working Group identified an increased\n\nrisk of evictions during the Covid-19 crisis as\n\nrestrictions to movement and trading have made it more difficult for people to pay rents \u2013 which in turn lead to evictions \u2013 as well as owners reclaiming building occupied by IDPs.\n\nThe East Africa region already has a high eviction\n\nrate, and as the previous examples illustrate, evictions are continuing despite Covid-19 and its accompanying impacts on health and livelihoods. The various restrictions put in place to limit the spread of Covid-19 will therefore likely exacerbate the impact of evictions, and further undermine the\n\nlimited legal protections tenants have against\n\nevictions. The majority of people evicted do not have a safety net. Thus while evictions already represent a significant protection threat, now in the context of Covid-19, they expose already vulnerable populations to greater risk of infection as people",

    "text": "53299\n\nThe next Strategic Situation Report will be released on 8 April\n\nSituation Overview: Global Update: According to John Hopkins University, more than 2.7 million people have now died with COVID-19 across the world. The pandemic is affecting 192 countries with more than 124 million confirmed cases globally, as of 25 March. WHO reports that while the emergence of new virus variants is common, those with higher speed of transmission or potentially increased pathogenicity (i.e. the capacity of a microbe to cause damage in a host) are very concerning. Crucial investigations are underway to comprehensively understand the behaviour of the new virus mutation (B117) and steer the response accordingly.\n\nAfghanistan: As of 25 March, MoPH data shows that 56,226 people across all 34 provinces in Afghanistan are confirmed to have had COVID-19. Some 49,802 people have recovered, and 2,467 people have died \u2013 at least 91 of whom are healthcare workers. Only 335,965 people out of a population of 40.4 million have been tested. Afghanistan now has a test-positivity-rate \u2013 positive tests as a percentage of total tests \u2013 of close to 17 per cent, suggesting overall under-testing of potential cases. The majority of recorded deaths were men between the ages of 50 and 79. Men account for almost 67 per cent of the total COVID-19 confirmed cases in the MoPH data, although this may be the result of over- representation of men in testing. Due to limited public health resources and testing capacity, lack of people coming forward for testing, as well as the absence of a national death register, confirmed cases of and deaths from COVID-19 are likely to be under-reported overall in Afghanistan. Stigma is considered a major factor in people Source: MoPH choosing not to get tests and risk communications work is critical to turning this around. WHO warns that widespread complacency and failure to follow public health advice in Afghanistan is creating grave risks in the community with people generally not observing physical distancing or mask wearing protocols. WHO Afghanistan remains concerned about mutations of the virus. There is significant increase in cases in Pakistan with the new variant which is potential more infectious and affect younger population. The Ministry of Public Health is preparing contingencies for a potential third wave which included scaling up surveillance at the border and improving testing.\n\nAlmost 8 per cent of the total confirmed COVID-19 cases are among healthcare staff and they are currently the highest priority for vaccination. There is urgent need to ensure continued distribution of medical and protective equipment to all corners of the country. While 22 laboratories are now operating in Afghanistan \u2013 with plans to scale-up to at least one laboratory per province by June 2021 \u2013 the capacity of these facilities remains limited and stocks of supplies have periodically run out. National capacity for COVID-19 testing has reached 8,500 samples a day however these laboratories are not being fully utilised. Humanitarian partners urge the Government to ensure laboratories are appropriately equipped, staff receive timely remuneration and that procured supplies go to under-resourced health centres in a transparent manner so that life-saving support can be delivered to those most in need.\n\nVaccination: The first batch of COVID-19 vaccinations through the COVAX facility \u2013 consisting of 468,000 doses \u2013 arrived on 8 March. Afghanistan is the first country in central Asia to receive the vaccine via COVAX \u2013 a facility that is set to deliver at least 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines globally by the end of 2021. To date, Afghanistan has received 968,000 doses of the vaccine \u2013 468,000 from the COVAX facility and 500,000 directly from the government of India-- enabling the vaccination of some 484,000 people. There remains some concern, however, around the perceived low demand among healthcare workers and the equitable access of vaccine among all Afghans.",

    "text": "29247\n\nIt has been one year since the conflict in Libya \u2013 and specifically around Tripoli \u2013 significantly intensified. Global\n\ncalls have been made for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow authorities address the ongoing COVID19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the contrary is happening. So far, conflicting parties have used the shift of international attention away from Libya as an opportunity to escalate military operations. Fighting has escalated in and around Tripoli.\n\nLibyans continue to face significant challenges as a result of the ongoing violent conflict. These challenges have been magnified by the current pandemic and escalation of attacks.\n\nSince the COVID19 pandemic reached Libya in March 20201, clashes in Tripoli and other western cities have been aggravated. Years of violence have left the healthcare system\n\nespecially vulnerable2. Recent attacks3 on health facilities and\n\nimportant hospitals (Tripoli\u2019s Al Khadra General Hospital) have made the situation more precarious. \u201cThis is a health\n\nsystem that was close to collapse before the coronavirus\u201d said Elizabeth Hof, head of mission for the World Health Organization in Libya. \u201cEquipment for testing is limited, there\n\nis very little protective gear, and there is a shortage of medical\n\nworkers, particularly in rural areas.\u201d4\n\n\u201cSome Libyans see coronavirus as an invisible enemy, and for a while they didn\u2019t even pay attention to the risk of coronavirus. It is not easy to tackle such a crisis\n\nduring war.\u201d\n\nDr. Rida Altubuly Director of Together We Build it, Tripoli\n\nLibyans have long suffered from electricity cuts and shortages,\n\nwhich have disrupted daily life. Significantly, food and water shortages, as well as an increase in food prices, have been reported. Previously, Libya did not experience substantial food\n\nshortages despite many years of war. The financial crisis that\n\nmany Libyans struggle with due to the conflict and the closing of oilfields has been exacerbated by the consequences of\n\nCOVID19. A main concern facing all population groups is the disruption to their livelihoods, especially for those in the informal economy. Furthermore, the banking crisis, due to the\n\nlack of liquidity, is also affecting Libyan families as they face\n\nincreasing difficulties obtaining cash from banks. Crowds\n\n1 The first case was officially confirmed in Tripoli on 24 March 2020. 2 https://www.icrc.org/en/document/libya-people-caught-between-bullets- 3 https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/libya-COVID19-situation-report-no-2-21-april-\n\nMAY 2020\n\ngather daily in front of banks in many parts of the country and\n\nsometimes people must wait weeks before they can withdraw funds. The sudden lockdowns announced by national authorities have led to panic-buying and large crowds at stores,\n\nwhich significantly hamper previous efforts to contain the\n\nspread of the virus.\n\nDespite the U.N. arms embargo on Libya, weapons continue to flow into the country via Libya\u2019s porous borders. On 1 April, the European Union launched its IRINI (meaning \u2018peace\u2019 in Greek)\n\nmission to enforce the arms embargo in the Mediterranean.\n\nQuestions remain whether this mission will actually be able to stop the supply of arms without affecting the fragile balance of power and benefiting one or more rival parties over the others.\n\n\u201cWe are at home, but it is not safe to be at home, we say\n\ncorona is below, and the war is above us. That\u2019s the reality of people. Last week the main hospital in Tripoli was targeted in the bombing. There are electricity\n\nshortages, there is water shortage in certain areas in\n\nTripoli and fear for food shortage as well.\u201d\n\nInas Miloud, Tamazight Women Movement\n\nThe migration hubs along the coasts hosting migrants have been targeted by air shelling. The situation of migrants in Libya is devastating: trapped in deplorable circumstances, without\n\nprotection, very much prone to COVID19 infection, and lacking\n\naccess to health services5. Many will not survive if the international community does not take immediate action.",

WFP/Taha Jawashi\n\nSituation Update\n\n\u2022 Efforts to reach a peaceful conclusion to the conflict in\n\nLibya continue amidst persisting political instability and a volatile security situation. Unrest since 2011 has caused\n\nthe economic and humanitarian situation in the country to deteriorate significantly; ongoing violence between multiple factions further aggravates an unstable\n\n\u2022 Livelihoods and access to basic social services have been\n\naffected by the conflict, exposing the most vulnerable people to high risk of inadequate food consumption. This often results in people using negative coping strategies, such as spending savings, cutting the number of daily meals and reducing non-food related expenses, particularly in health and education.\n\n\u2022 Due to limited port access and road blockages, food\n\nimports into Libya have dwindled, causing food prices to skyrocket. The prices of many staple food items, such as rice and wheat flour, have increased by as much as 200 percent when compared to pre-conflict levels.\n\n\u2022 People struggle to purchase enough food because they\n\nlack access to cash. The banking system has been disrupted due of declining oil revenues, hampering people\u2019s access to their money.\n\n\u2022 According to the 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview, 1.1\n\nmillion people, of whom 378,000 are children and 307,000 are women of reproductive age (15-49), require life-saving humanitarian assistance and protection.\n\nWFP Response\n\n\u2022 WFP has been providing emergency relief in Libya since April 2011, when the uprising in Libya caused major food shortages in conflict areas across the country.\n\nPage | 1\n\n\u2022 Other initiatives ongoing include expanded support to other vulnerable population groups as well as a cash-based transfer pilot.\n\nFood and Nutrition Assistance\n\n\u2022 Through its Emergency Operation (EMOP) 200925, WFP aims to provide food assistance to people who are food insecure as a result of the conflict in Libya; up until now, this support has been mainly provided to IDPs, returnees and refugees, with priority given to unemployed female-headed households, identified as one of the most vulnerable groups.\n\n\u2022 Until now, WFP\u2019s assistance has been through the\n\nprovision of in-kind food assistance. Each family receives two food parcels, enough to support five people for one month. The parcels consist of rice, pasta, wheat flour, chickpeas, vegetable oil, sugar and tomato paste. The food entitlements provide 75 percent (1,530 kcal) of daily energy requirements per person per day. WFP is using feedback of those who receive food parcels to revise the contents of the basket, which may subsequently change.\n\n\u2022 WFP provides food assistance throughout Libya\n\nprimarily through two local Cooperating Partners (CPs), the Sheikh Taher Azzawi Charity Organization (STACO) and Ayady Al Khair Society (AKS). Efforts are underway to significantly expand the reliable partnership base in order to ensure that WFP can respond immediately to needs throughout the country.\n\n\u2022 WFP determines the most affected people in\n\nconsultation with local crisis committees and partners. WFP collaborates with the Libya UN Country Team (UNCT) and the Security Management Team to coordinate its activities with other United Nations agencies and to assess the political and security situation and the resulting\n\nimpact on operations.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\n\u2022 As Libya changes, so must WFP\u2019s response; as\n\nsuch, the operation is adapting and growing in response to the needs in-country. WFP\u2019s new programmatic directions will focus on livelihoods and helping to stabilize the process in the country, including through the gradual recovery and strengthening of national safety net systems.",

This high level of acute malnutrition indicates an extremely stressed population including food insecurity, poor sanitation and hygiene and health conditions which are the key underlying causes of acute Detailed analysis among newly arrived population with good quality and adequate sample size showed severe consumption deficits and concerning SAM rates (18.1 & 15.4 percent) in Bama and Damboa LGAs, whereas near Extremely Critical (Phase 5) GAM rates were found in Bama, Damboa, Madagli, Konduga, Gwoza and Kukawa; The Crude and Under-five Mortality Rates were; 4.09 and 7.13 deaths/10,000/day respectively, both of which reduced to CMR of 2.39 and U5MR of 3.58 respectively after exclusion of data from Gwoza which had quality issues and was exceptionally high. Both crude and under-five mortality rates were above emergency thresholds and illness constituted the main cause of death. Mortality data is currently undergoing further investigation to identify and rectify quality issues during the next FMS round. \u2022 The elevated levels of consumption gaps, malnutrition, mortality and pervasive usage of emergency coping strategies, is largely underscored by limited availability of food stocks, restricted access to functional markets and water, health and sanitation services, which might heighten morbidity risk and impact households' ability to engage in labour for food or resource gathering.\n\nThe insurgency in the North East States of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe continues to take render some areas totally or partially inaccessible to humanitarian response agencies/partners. The protracted nature of this conflict in Northeast has made the\n\nhumanitarian crisis much more complicated, and, rendering parts of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe State inaccessible.1 To address information gaps facing the humanitarian response in Northeast Nigeria and inform humanitarian actors on the demographics of the population in inaccessible areas, and identify their needs, access to services and movement intentions, there have been joint efforts by various stakeholders proffer solutions.\n\n1 Areas designated in North-east Nigeria as all areas where humanitarian cannot access to provide assistance to affected populations, and where populations cannot access humanitarian to receive assistance either. The Nigeria Access Working Group has also defined 9 more formal criteria to designate inaccessible areas (internal document)\n\nSeveral cycles of the Cadre Harmonis\u00e9 (CH) analysis unveiled the problem situation of populations in some inaccessible areas. From the results of March 2021 CH analysis in which 746,846 and 881,261 persons for current (March \u2013 May) and Projected (June \u2013 August) period, respectively, were classified in phase 3 \u2013 4 of acute food and nutrition insecurity across the inaccessible areas of the BAY states. Moreover, the findings suggest a famine-like food consumption pattern among minority of the inaccessible population (\u226410 percent), which was reflective in severe food consumption deficits, extremely limited diversity of diets and pervasive",

This includes food assistance on average every month reaching 2 million people dispatched through the cross-border operation from Syria Cross-Border HLG and NES NGO Forum, assisting areas not accessible from Syria HCT1.\n\nIn addition to regular food basket distribution, over 1 million people benefitted through the distribution of Emergency Food Rations (EFRs), with 1 million (97%) of the people supported through Syria Cross-Border HLG. EFR support includes emergency cash assistance, cooked meals, ready to eat rations and emergency.\n\nThrough emergency agriculture assistance, livelihoods, and resilience activities under sector objectives 2 and 3, FSS WoS partners across all hubs had reached over 395,000 people (65,885 HHs). Across the different hubs, partners from Syria Cross-Border HLG reached 177,419 people (29,570 HHs) and from NES NGO Forum partners reached 113,983 people (18,997 HHs). Support provided was to enhance self-reliance of affected households by protecting and building productive assets and restoring or creating income generating opportunities to save and sustain lives.\n\nCash and voucher support: In Q1 2021 FSS partners assisted on average 582,000 people with cash and vouchers monthly through food baskets and with a total of 116,294 people cumulatively with agriculture and livelihood support.\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\n\u2022 The crisis in Syria has entered its 10th year, with 2020 having seen the emergence of new and complex socioeconomic difficulties that are further exacerbating the food security and livelihood situation of families across the country.\n\n\u2022 The situation in Syria has drastically deteriorated with an estimated 14.2 million people in need of some form of food and agriculture assistance, representing 68.6% of the total population; Based on a countrywide assessment of 36,484 households and technical reviews and consultations, at least 12.4 million people are estimated to be food insecure, of which 1.3 million people are considered severely food insecure. Furthermore, all 1.7 million1 people living in camps are deemed to be 100% food insecure, and 1.8 million people are estimated to be at risk2 of food insecurity3 .\n\n\u2022 The results show a sharp increase from last year, with an increase of 4.5 million people facing acute food insecurity in 2021 compared to 2020. Whereas in 2019, 39% of the total population was food insecure, that figure is now almost 60% in 2020. The number of severely food insecure people has also increased from 3% (0.6 million) of the population in 2019 to 6% (1.3 million) in 2020.\n\n\u2022 The focus on assessment and monitoring activities has been on Food Security & Livelihood (FSLA) reassessment of 13 Sub-districts in North West Syria (NWS) to ascertain a more accurate picture of the food insecurity situation in these areas.\n\nAGRICULTURE SEASONAL PERFORMANCE AND LIVELIHOODS\n\n\u2022 Rainfall: The 2020/2021 agricultural season was characterized by delayed onset of rainfall by at least 2 months in all governorates since the rainfall started in the beginning of November 2020. By the end of April 2021, the cumulative rainfall for the current season which starts from September 2020 to end of April 2021, was weak to very weak in the North-Eastern governorates and the Eastern regions especially in Deir-er-Zor. In April 2021, the precipitation was good and slightly higher than averages in Quneitra and the coastal governorates, and weak to very weak in the rest of the governorates (i.e., 30 \u2013 80% below the average), especially in Deir-er-Zor. The unfavorable agro-climatic conditions that prevailed during the 2020/2021 season are likely to affect agricultural production and the sector and FAO are closely monitoring the situation and conducting further assessments.",

Humanitarian situations, be they natural or human-made disasters, do not generate, but rather exacerbate the rates of gender-based violence.\n\nEmotional and/or sexual violence is the manifestation of the pervasive, systematic and structural discrimination girls and women face. Discrimination reveals itself in multiple ways, therefore it is critical to analyse and understand inequalities.\n\nFor instance, while 39 per cent of the national Cameroonian population lives below the poverty line, this rate rises to 51.5 per cent for women.

Eight persons are currently stranded in I\u00f1apari (Madre de Dios) after being unable to cross. The GTRM does not endorse nor support these returns as they highly increase protection risks of already vulnerable communities. \u2022 Some refugee and migrant hosted in supported shelters have not been able to register their newborns. The GTRM is following up with authorities to ensure the registration takes place. According to the World Bank (WB), most Venezuelan employees work for small enterprises, which are impacted the most by the current emergency. The WB estimates that less than 10 per cent of these refugees and migrants have a formal contract. Concerns over food security and risk of eviction remain a priority.\n\nRESPONSE .\n\nProtection, Health and Integration\n\nGTRM partners continue working to prevent and mitigate protection risks amid the emergency through COVID-19 context tailored trainings on gender-based violence (GVB) and child protection. Training calendar available here. In coordination with the Ministry of Health, partners are organizing the distribution of some 50 Refugee housing units (RHU) across country to strengthen health infrastructures during the emergency. Integration partners presented a new project for the economic inclusion of refugee and migrants from Venezuela and host communities in Peru and Ecuador. The objective is to enable access of 100,000 persons to financial services, develop the capacities of 10,000 persons to create sustainable livelihoods, and increase the income of 2,500 persons.\n\nOPERATIONAL MEASURES\n\nTo date, USD 2,200,000 have been distributed on Cash-Based Interventions (CBI) in support of some 50,000 refugees and migrants in Peru. Distributions focused in Lima, Arequipa, Callao, Cusco, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Madre de Dios, Piura, Tacna and Tumbes. GTRM partners distributed some 1,000 food kits from private donations. The distribution was made in coordination with the National Institute of Civil Defense (INDECI), door to door and through soup-kitchens. It benefited some 4,000 vulnerable refugees and migrants in Lima and Callao. GTRM partners have distributed 10,000 NFI kits, including winter support and kits for GVB survivors. Partners distributed winter cloths to children in shelters, donated by the Municipality of Lima.\n\nKEY FIGURES\n\nREFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ASSISTED.",

    "text": "18348\n\nWFP Ecuador Country Brief July 2019\n\nContact info: Tatiana Almeida (tatiana.almeida@wfp.org) Country Director: Mario Touchette Further information: https://opweb.wfp.org/country/mng/?UNC=218\n\nIn Numbers\n\nUS$ 1,515,634 cash-based transfers made USD 7.3 m six months net funding requirements\n\n87,080 people assisted in July 2019\n\nOperational Updates\n\nThe state of emergency for human mobility has been extended until August 2019. 58,629 people benefited from WFP\u2019s food vouchers. The majority were Venezuelans (88.89 percent), followed by Colombians (10.73 percent) and a few beneficiaries of other nationalities. 3,782 people, around 69.5 percent of them from Venezuela, were assisted at shelters and canteens managed by partner organizations. 16,324 vulnerable Venezuelans received one-time food assistance at immigration checkpoints. WFP started providing cash-based transfers to vulnerable pregnant adolescents from the northern border provinces. This is a pilot initiative aimed at contributing to adequate access to food among this priority group. An official delegation from USAID/FFP visited WFP's field operation in Sucumb\u00edos and Azuay. The school year 2018-2019 ended on July 5th and 8,326 children from Carchi, Imbabura and Sucumb\u00edos were assisted through the complementary school meals program. Through a national workshop, WFP socialized its complementary school meals program with high- level government authorities, UN agencies and relevant stakeholders. Upon the National Risk Management and Emergency Service (SNGRE) request, WFP delivered food kits to support families that were affected by the flood of the Putumayo River in Sucumb\u00edos. Following the partners and stakeholders'\n\nconsultations within the framework of the\n\nIntegrated Context Analysis (ICA) held on February 2019, WFP, in coordination with the SNGRE, implemented the seasonal livelihood\n\nprogramming consultation in July to strengthen\n\nthe design, planning and implementation of programs in the field of resilience, social protection networks, disaster risk reduction, and\n\n\u2022 Complement the Government's social protection strategy by providing Cash-Based Transfers to the most vulnerable populations and support in vulnerability analysis and knowledge management. \u2022 Strengthen strategies to link sustainable livelihoods to food security and nutrition activities.\n\n\u2022 Support and increase the participation of smallholder farmer organizations in national and local commercial mechanisms and institutional markets. \u2022 Strengthen the capacity of farmer organizations.\n\n\u2022 Strengthen or develop emergency preparedness, response, and early warning systems. \u2022 Strengthen the implementation of adaptation and resilience\n\n\u2022 Technical assistance, research and assessments, to improve the implementation of programs linked to food security and nutrition. \u2022 Knowledge management and sharing of best practices and studies, including through South-South cooperation.\n\n\u2022 Since April 1st 2017, the Country Strategic Plan for Ecuador positions WFP as a strategic and public policy partner. WFP supports government efforts to achieve SDGs 2 and 17 through four outcomes. Each strategic outcome includes activities corresponding to government priorities and WFP's experience and expertise.\n\nThe five-year strategy envisages a decrease in WFP's direct implementation of programmes and the progressive handover of activities to the Government.\n\nWFP Ecuador Country Brief July 2019\n\nThe country\u2019s current economic situation curbs access to adequate employment opportunities for locals as well as for newly arrived migrants. This may create tensions and increase difficulties of integration into local communities. The State of Emergency declared by the Government continues only in Carchi, Pichincha and El Oro. Limiting the emergency status to these provinces do not fully reflect the increasing needs of Venezuelan migrants nationwide. As the migration flow of Venezuelans into the region is growing, WFP faces challenges in mobilizing additional resources to assist vulnerable households.",

    "text": "31979\n\nUPDATE No 15\n\nSITUATION/CONTEXT INFORMATION .\n\nOn 22 May, the President extended the state of emergency and quarantine until 30 June. New measures include the reduction of curfew time and the resumption of e-commerce, as well as of technical services, such as carpentry, plumbing, hairdressing, IT and odontology, among others. On 26 May, the Minister of Foreign Affairs participated in the International Donors Conference for refugees and migrants from Venezuela, convened by the European Union and Spain. The Minister highlighted the challenges the country is facing to meet the demands of the population, including those of vulnerable refugees and migrants, amid the efforts to contain the pandemic.\n\nKEY IMPACTS, NEEDS AND RISKS .\n\nSo far, GTRM partners reported some 150 cases of confirmed COVID-19 infections among refugees and migrants, with some suspicious cases having no access to medical attention and testing. While some shelters have isolation areas, the high concentration of vulnerable refugees and migrants in these spaces raises concern. Access to medical attention outside of the current sanitary emergency is increasingly limited for both refugee, migrants and host communities, as most medical resources are concentrated in the response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. This heightens the need to continue advocating for the enhancement of basic health services in the public health system.\n\nSoaring risks over the heightened economic vulnerability of Venezuelans and their host communities continue to draw attention over the urgent need to generate income to cover food security and shelter. Aside from the need to scale up CBI, supporting projects that enable self-reliance and economic integration remains a priority.\n\nRESPONSE .\n\nThe GTRM is responding to the increase of violence against women and children through a series of tailored trainings to develop the capacity of frontline government and humanitarian actors. These workshops focus on expanding the know-how needed to assist vulnerable population remotely through hotlines, protection of sexual exploitation and abuse, psychosocial support to reduce the impact of human mobility and gender- based violence amid the emergency, and on addressing human trafficking and smuggling.\n\nOPERATIONAL MEASURES\n\nTo date, USD 1,600,000 have been distributed on Cash-Based Interventions (CBI) in support of over 32,000 refugees and migrants across Peru. Distributions focused in Lima, Arequipa, Callao, Cusco, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Madre de Dios, Piura, Tacna and Tumbes. GTRM partners have assisted more than 600 refugees and migrants through the improvement and management of shelters. Partners have supported over 6,000 vulnerable refugees and migrants through health and nutrition services, including nutrition for pregnant women and mental health assistance. Partners in Tumbes are providing trainings in shelters on COVID-19 prevention and supporting the production of some 300 cloth face masks, with the assistance of Venezuelan volunteers, to distribute to vulnerable refugees, migrants and host community.\n\nKEY FIGURES\n\nREFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ASSISTED.",

    "text": "45398\n\nWFP Chad Country Brief January 2020\n\nContact info: Mar\u00eda Gallar (maria.gallar@wfp.org) Country Director a.i: Sally Haydock Further information: www.wfp.org/Chad Main photo Credit: Princess Sarah Zeid of Jordan visits a health centre in N\u2019Djamena. Caption: WFP/Maria Gallar.\n\nIn Numbers\n\n1,089 mt of food assistance distributed USD 1.47 m cash-based transfers made USD 88 m six months (February -July 2020) net funding requirements representing 52% of total\n\n387,307 people assisted in January 2020\n\nOperational Updates\n\nSince late December 2019, inter-communal clashes in the West Darfur town of Geneina -12 kilometers away from the Chad-Sudan border - have led to a steady influx of refugees into Chad. Latest arrivals bring the estimated number of new Sudanese refugees to 16,250, while tension persists. The High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) declared a Level 2 Emergency for the Sudanese refugee influx into eastern Chad.\n\nThe new refugees are scattered across the province of Ouaddai, which already hosts 190,000 Sudanese refugees since the conflict erupted in 2003. New refugees are being transferred to the site of Kouchaguine Moura in the department of Oura. From 4 to 20 February, UNHCR expects to transfer 500 people every two days to this new camp and plans on opening an antenna in Amleyouna to cover Kouchaguine Moura and the camp of Gaga, which has existed since 2005.\n\nWFP is managing the emergency response operation from its logistics base in Abeche and the sub-office of Farchana. In January, WFP carried out a first distribution for 3,400 people and 498 children in seven sites, which had arrived in the first half of the month, to cover their needs for 15 days. From February onwards, WFP will be providing full rations to refugees relocated in Kouchaguine Moura. Contingency stocks are already in place in case of further arrivals.\n\nAn assessment from the Chadian Red Cross estimated that more than 80,000 people were affected by floods in the province of Mayo Kebbi East during the last quarter of 2019. Additionally, 14,500 houses were destroyed or seriously damaged and some 19,000 hectares of harvests were lost. In January 2020, WFP provided emergency food assistance to 44,000 people in the departments of Mont Illi, Mayo Boneye and Kabbia, which were among the most affected.\n\nOn 13 January, WFP launched a call for proposals on resilience and peacebuilding-related assistance in 2020. The aim is to enable better planning and to deliver better targeted, more effective assistance to populations in need. 65 international and national non-governmental organisations participated to the briefing session.\n\n\uf0b7 Provide an integrated assistance package to crisis-affected people, including food assistance (conditional and/or unconditional), school meals, and specialized nutritious food to children and PLW/Gs and people living with HIV\n\nor TB for malnutrition prevention and treatment\n\n\uf0b7 Provide seasonal food assistance to targeted food insecure people. \uf0b7 Provide school meals to vulnerable children during the school year, in a way\n\nthat relies on and stimulates local production\n\n\uf0b7 Provide a malnutrition prevention package of specialized nutritious food to children aged 6-23 months and PLWG; cash transfers to PLWG attending\n\npre-/post-natal care; and SBCC measures for the latter and their \uf0b7 Provide a malnutrition treatment package of (i) specialized nutritious food to children aged 6-59 months and PLW/Gs; and (ii) SBC-measures to them and their wider communities \uf0b7 Provide adapted support to targeted people for local fortified nutritious food production.\n\n\uf0b7 Provide livelihood and asset support, including the development or rehabilitation of natural and productive assets and infrastructure and local purchases, to food-insecure and at-risk people.\n\n\uf0b7 Provide training and technical support to national institutions on the design and implementation of a permanent response-planning scheme for food security and nutrition with consolidated early-warning and coordination mechanisms, as well as a shock-responsive, nutrition-sensitive and gender- transformative safety net (supporting strategic outcomes 1 and 2); training and communication schemes for improved nutrition and resilient agricultural practices (strategic outcomes 3 d 4); and improved food and nutrition coordination mechanisms.",

The number confirmed COVID-19 cases in West and Central Africa (WCAR) is at 216,806 as of 28 September 2020 which confirms the downward trend in the number of new cases in the region. The number of active cases in the region continues its steady decline which started at the end of July, going from 48,443 on 20 July 2020 to 21,329 as of 28 September 2020. As of 28 September 2020, Nigeria (58,324) remains with the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by Ghana (46,387), Cameroon (20,735), Cote d\u2019Ivoire (19,629) and Senegal (14,909). In terms of active cases, Nigeria (7,422) has the highest number, followed by CAR (2,904), Senegal (2,488), Gambia (1,297) and Cameroon (877). (N.B. The exact number of COVID-19 cases in the region remains uncertain, considering the comparatively low testing in the region. Death tolls may exclude people who did not die in hospital, or before they could be tested).\n\nCOVID-19 Cases in West and Central Africa by Country:\n\nCOVID-19 EMERGENCY RESPONSE UPDATE > West & Central Africa / 01 Oct. 2020\n\nHeavy rains and floods in West and Central Africa. UNHCR Operations are facing various operational challenges including, among others the heavy rains that have caused severe floods in several parts of West and Central Africa in the past few weeks. The pre-existing shelter needs in the region have been compounded by the effects of these extreme natural events, particularly in the Sahel where over 700,000 people have been affected by the recent floods. Across the region, infrastructure including medical facilities have been badly damaged, impacting national responses to COVID-19 and other illnesses such as malaria and measles. With water sources contaminated and latrines flooded, fears are rising that cholera could spread. Crops have been destroyed in the floods, increasing food shortages and the vulnerabilities of farmers and their families whose livelihoods depend on harvests. UNHCR is scaling up its shelter interventions to reinforce existing settlements, build new ones in safer areas, and to relocate affected displaced families.\n\nSpecific protection risks and challenges for forcibly displaced populations. Refugees and IDPs are often residing in overcrowded and precarious conditions rendering impossible social distancing or basic preventive measures such as hand\n\nwashing which exposes them to heightened risks of contamination as COVID-19 cases. Forcibly displaced populations are also at heightened risk of stigmatization in\n\nsituations of pandemic. In addition to these specific challenges, forcible displaced populations are also facing the risk of food insecurity in the region, particularly in the\n\nSahel. There are also great concerns regarding gender-based violence which is on the rise since the beginning of the COVID crisis as a direct result of the preventive",

Targeted quarantine remains in place. WFP subscribed field level agreements with three international NGOs to advance with its cash-based response for vulnerable Venezuelan migrants and vulnerable local population affected by the COVID-19 crisis. As part of the virtual commemoration of the World Humanitarian Day, INDECI presented awards to humanitarian partners, including WFP, for their valuable support for the COVID-19 emergency response. WFP's support for logistics operations was highly The WFP Country Director and PAHO/WHO Representative jointly conducted an official visit to Ancash for the inauguration of a new call centre to assist COVID-19 cases managed by the Regional Health Directorate. They also met with regional government authorities and distributed PPE and hygiene kits. WFP and the Secretariat of the UN Network for SUN (Scaling Up Nutrition) completed the Nutrition Stakeholder and Action Mapping in Peru, the first SUN country in Latin America to do so, with the support of a multidisciplinary technical committee and five ministries. WFP participated in a national dialogue organized by the National Round Table for the Fight Against Poverty to discuss the impact of the current COVID-19 context on food security and nutrition. Through its Wi\u00f1antsik Project, WFP distributed hygiene kits to 17 health centres in the Ancash region. WFP\u2019s PROSAN Project supported the first Agro-ecological Fair in Sechura in coordination with the local municipality enabling smallholder farmers to directly market their products. WFP started implementing virtual learning groups in three schools in Ventanilla as part of its strategy to promote healthy nutrition at schools. An additional eight schools in Sechura will also take part in this initiative.\n\n\u2022 Provide assistance to the Government, civil society, private sector and academia to build an alliance to achieve SDG 2, establishing targets and allocating resources and commitments towards zero\n\nhunger goals.\n\n\u2022 Provide capacity strengthening and technical assistance \u2013 including through South-south cooperation and technology transfer \u2013 to all three levels of government through research, evidence generation and assessments to implement innovative, inclusive nutrition intervention models adapted to the regional/cultural context.\n\n\u2022 Provide capacity strengthening and technical assistance at the policy and operational levels for national and subnational authorities to improve the integration and efficiency of social protection and disaster risk management programmes geared towards the needs of\n\nthe most vulnerable populations.\n\n\u2022 Technical assistance, research and assessments, to improve the implementation of programs linked to food security and nutrition. \u2022 Knowledge management and sharing of best practices and studies, including through South-South cooperation.\n\n\u2022 Facilitate the provision of life-saving interventions through direct support for the government's humanitarian supply chain\n\nWFP Peru Country Brief August 2020\n\nWFP launched a hotline to collect beneficiaries' feedback and complaints. This is part of the operational adjustments related to the implementation of direct food assistance as an emergency response\n\nCapacity Building\n\nThe National Institute of Civil Defence (INDECI) approved a \u201cMonitoring, Follow-up and Evaluation Plan\u201d that will guide the monitoring and evaluation of the National Risk Management Plan (PLANAGERD 2014- 2021). WFP provided direct technical support to adapt the Emergency Preparedness Capacity Index (EPCI) to the national context. This tool allows to assess national and local emergency response capabilities providing valuable inputs for decision makers. As EPCI is now officially part of INDECI\u2019s evaluation tools, WFP will continue providing support for its annual update in direct coordination with INDECI. Due to COVID-19, the methodology to update EPCI has been adapted to virtual settings. So far, virtual workshops have been organized with the municipality of Lima and Carayballo. Additional virtual workshops are planned with national and local stakeholders from the regions of Tumbes, La Libertad and Lambayeque.",

The next report will be issued when additional information on the emergency becomes available.\n\nHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE SCALED UP AS NEEDS INCREASE\n\nDuring the first 10 days of November, there was a marked increase in airstrikes, artillery fire and clashes in Al Hudaydah Governorate, especially around Al Hudaydah City. Hotspots included the airport area to the south of the city, and the areas around Kilo 10 and Kilo 16 to the east, the university and Al Thawrah Hospital towards the coast. Clashes were reported close to 90 Street and at the airport junction in the Alrabasa area to the northeast. Other districts in Al Hudaydah Governorate that were hit by airstrikes included Al Marawi\u2019ah, Ad Durayhimi, Al Hawak, Al Hali, As Salif and Zabid,\n\nand clashes continued in the Hays area. Further south, heavy shelling was reported in At Tuhayat town on 6 and 7 November. To the north, in Hajjah Governorate, by 7 November, the fighting had reportedly moved to A\u2019shim Junction, Haradh and Mustaba districts, and armed clashes were reported around Haradh town. The intensity of fighting reduced in Al Hudaydah City on 12 November, amidst reports of a possible de-escalation in hostilities, although some renewed fighting and airstrikes were reported again on 13 November, leading to a number of injuries.\n\nCivilian Casualties\n\nThe conflict in Al Hudaydah Governorate continues to exact a high civilian toll and to damage civilian infrastructure. The Protection Cluster\u2019s Civilian Impact Monitoring Project (CIMP) reported 37 casualties between 18 and 31 October across the Al Hudaydah hub, including 21 civilians who died in an attack on a vegetable packing facility in Bayt Al Faqiah District. In the first week of November, as the conflict escalated, the Protection Cluster reported 92 civilian casualties, 34 of them fatalities. Most casualties were in Al Hali and Al Hawak districts on the outskirts of Al Hudaydah City, where some of the heaviest fighting was reported. CIMP also reported damage to civilian infrastructure.\n\nOverall estimates of civilian casualties in Al Hudaydah and surrounding governorates since the initial escalation of fighting in June 2018 vary, and are likely to be underestimates. Between 13\n\nAccess challenges\n\nFurther fighting across Al Hudaydah Governorate could obstruct access, trap civilians and impede access to humanitarian warehouses and other facilities. Already, humanitarian movement and access to warehouses and to people in need have become more difficult or impossible in some cases. During the reporting period, WFP was unable to access 51,000 metric tons (MT) of wheat grain, enough to feed 3.5 million people for a month, that is stored at the Red Sea Mills at Kilo 10, because of the fighting. Similarly, a key UNHCR warehouse\n\nJune and 22 October (before the recent escalation of fighting), WHO recorded 193 conflict-related deaths (135 men, 21 women, 25 boys and 12 girls) and 2,091 injured (2,033 men, 28 women, 25 boys and five girls) based on health-facility reporting in Al Hudaydah Governorate.\n\nFighting near hospitals in Al Hudaydah is jeopardizing the lives of health workers and patients. \u00a9WHO/ Sadeq Al Wesabi\n\nwhere emergency shelter and non-food items are stored has also become inaccessible due to\n\nPartners in Al Hudaydah City are ready to move supplies from warehouses and other facilities, if conditions allow for safe access to premises. In Aden, partners are drafting contingency plans to ensure continued access and response to the population in Al Mokha, Al Khawkhah, Hays and At Tuhayat districts.\n\nCivilian displacement\n\nFollowing the escalation of fighting at the start of November, civilian displacement was reported in Al Hudaydah City with some families fleeing their homes in neighbourhoods around Al Hudaydah University and Tehama Development Authority in the Alrabasa area. However, no mass displacement was reported. On 5 and 6 November, following overnight airstrikes, about 300 families fled their homes in the 7 July neighbourhood and 90 Street to seek refuge in Bajil and As Sukhanah districts. Some civilians were reportedly trapped between the university and airport in Al Hudaydah City.",

That warning was the trigger for the UN to immediately release $5.2 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to help communities urgently prepare and protect themselves.\n\nThe money went to three participating agencies \u2013 the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to enable them to prepare to distribute cash, livestock feed, storage drums, and hygiene, dignity and health kits.\n\nOn 11 July, the activation trigger was reached when forecasting predicted the floods would reach critical levels in five days. At this point, aid workers began distributing the\n\nBangladesh is highly vulnerable to climate-related shocks and stresses, including monsoon flooding. In an average year, approximately one quarter of the country is inundated. In some years, flooding is more intense and surpasses the ability of communities to cope, leading to death and the destruction of infrastructure, livelihoods and homes, and creates deep humanitarian needs. However, monsoon flooding can be predicted, and humanitarian needs minimized.\n\nThis is the latest example of anticipatory humanitarian action. Developments in data and predictive analytics make it possible to anticipate when disaster is about to strike and take action in advance. This approach offers a more dignified, swifter, cheaper and more efficient solution to humanitarian needs.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to mobilize and coordinate effective and principled humanitarian action in partnership with national and international actors\n\nWorking alongside government, staff from the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), partners began giving communities at risk in the Bogura, Gaibandha, Kurigram, Jamalpur and Sirajgonj districts the means to protect themselves and their livelihoods from the worst effects of the floods.\n\nFAO is delivering sealable drums in which farmers can safely store their seeds and farming tools. The drums can be fixed to immoveable structures and withstand submersion in water, keeping the contents safe and undamaged by flood waters, allowing farmers to resume productive activities as soon as it\u2019s safe to return. This is coupled with feed support to smallholder farmers at evacuation centres to keep their livestock healthy and alive throughout the peak of the floods. In all, 15,000 families will benefit.\n\nUNFPA is delivering hygiene kits, dignity kits and health kits to 15,000 women and girls and the transgender community, providing them essential sexual and reproductive health supplies. The kits will also include flashcards with COVID- 19 precautionary measures, as well as helplines to report incidents of gender- based violence and to receive psychosocial support.\n\nWFP is delivering cash assistance of $53 to almost 20,000 households (around 100,000 people) via mobile banking. This allows families to spend the money as they choose - to protect themselves from the flooding and build their resilience. They can allocate the money for food, medicines, clothes, or transportation away from the flood sites while the waters are at their highest.",

    "text": "11693\n\nContext and Methodology\n\nQuestionnaire and data are available here.\n\nFollowing military movements in Southern Libya, hundreds of households have been displaced and humanitarian access has been restricted(1). In March 2019, WFP piloted remote mobile phone surveys in southern Libya to collect information on people\u2019s perceptions on the food security and humanitarian situation. In August 2018, the Multi-Sectoral Needs Assessment (MSNA) showed that food insecurity prevalence is higher in the South(2). This mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (mVAM) bulletin is based on data collected from households via live telephone interviews between 1st and 12th March 2019. The telephone numbers called were collected as part of the 2018 MSNA. The data presented was collected from a sample of 103 respondents from the six southern Libyan mantikas, or districts (Aljufra, Ghat, Murzuq, Sebha, Ubari and Wadi Ashshati). Responses are aggregated at the baladiya (sub-district) level. Some baladiyas were excluded from this analysis as there were not enough respondents to triangulate the information (a minimum of three respondents was considered).\n\nSource: WFP Libya/Flavia Brunetti 2018\n\nThe bakeries are reported open in all surveyed areas. In Murzuq, some bakeries remained closed for two to four days or closed earlier in the day due to the unavailability of wheat flour. The price of bread varies in the surveyed locations between three and four regular-size loaves per one dinar (see chart), whereas according to the Libya Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (3) in the majority of eastern mantikas (where the price is more stable), households could buy five loaves for the same price. Respondents did not mention change in quantity or quality of the bread. In Ubari, respondents from one neighbourhood )\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0634\u0644\u0627( mentioned that they could only get two loaves for one dinar.\n\n(3) https://reliefweb.int/report/libya/libya-joint-market-monitoring-initiative-jmmi-1-12-march-2019\n\nFood markets are reportedly generally open. However, 45% of the respondents in Murzuq and 33% in Bint Bayya (Ubari) reported safety concerns hindered their movement and regular access to markets. According to surveyed households, all main food commodities are available in the markets, but cooking gas is reported not available by more than a third of the respondents in the surveyed locations. This share goes up to 50 percent in Bint Bayya (Ubari).\n\nSome respondents in each of the six Southern Mantikas reported food assistance reaching their towns in the past month. In Aljufra and Ghat people surveyed mentioned adequate quantities of food assistance whereas in Murzuq, Sebha, Ubari and Wadi Ashshati, people reported low quantities of food assistance reaching the areas. Respondents in Hijz and El Horria localities in Murzuq said no assistance was received. The United Nations agencies, NGOs and cooperatives )\u062a\u0627\u064a\u0639\u0645\u062c( were the organisations most quoted as providing food assistance in the surveyed locations.\n\nMost respondents indicated that the general economic situation did not change from February to March. Only 9% reported a deterioration. In Ghat, 70% of the respondents noticed an However, in all surveyed areas, access to cash from the bank was reported as an In Murzuq, respondents mentioned there is no cash available at all. A respondent from Murzuq also reported insecurity as an additional reason preventing them to withdraw money from banks. In Aljufra, no cash had been available for the past four months. In Wadi Ashshati, a limit of 500 LYD withdrawal per month was reported and in Ubari 500 LYD per week.\n\nIn Ghat, Murzuq and Ubari respondents reported that new IDP families have arrived in the last month due to the ongoing conflict (between 7 and 20 households per location approximately). Most of the respondents from surveyed locations, with the exception of Ghat and Sebha, indicated that migrants are in need of humanitarian assistance (food, protection and health), especially the ones from Sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "text": "15294\n\nRegional Overview \u2013 Africa 9 July 2019\n\nMaya Moseley\n\nJuly 9,\n\nNotable developments during the week of June 30th include military offensives against militias in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria, a deadly airstrike on a migrant detention center in Tripoli, and continued inter-communal violence in Mali. In Sudan, the Transitional Military Council and the Alliance for Freedom and Change (AFC) reached an agreement for a transitional government.\n\nMilitary forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo continued operations against armed militias in the Eastern provinces. In Ituri, military forces carried operations against the Cooperative for Development of Congo (CODECO) militia, which is mainly comprised of ethnic Lendu. The group is believed to be responsible for recent attacks on Hema communities, which President Felix Tshisekedi called an \u2018attempted genocide\u2019. Military forces carried out an offensive against the militia in the Wago area. Despite these operations, attacks on civilians in the Djugu territory have persisted. They have not been on the same scale as the June massacres, but there were several attacks on civilians this week. IDPs appear to have been specifically targeted in four attacks, which resulted in 10 reported fatalities. The current unrest in the province has destabilized the relative calm it has recently\n\nViolent attacks rose in Katsina, Nigeria this week, with a series of attacks targeting civilians. The attacks began on June 29th, with 10 villages in the Kankara local government area, resulting in 11 fatalities. Three villages in the Dan Musa area were attacked on July 3rd, resulting in 17 fatalities. While it remains unclear who the perpetrators are, the attacks signal an escalation of violence in these areas. Meanwhile, in Zamfara state, military forces launched an offensive against militias this week involving a series of ground battles and airstrikes. In Bawa, military forces killed 10 combatants. Airstrikes were also carried out in the areas of Dumburum and Munhaye, resulting in a reported 30 fatalities.\n\nAristrikes continue to take a toll on civilians in Libya. On July 2, an airstrike, likely carried out by Khalifa Haftar\u2019s Libyan National Army (LNA), hit a detention center run by the Government of National Accord (GNA) for undocumented immigrants in Tagiura, Tripoli. At least fifty-three people were killed in the attack, while a reported 136 others were injured. Some reports indicate guards at the facility fired on migrants who attempted to flee the airstrikes. Approximately 300 migrants were still being held in the facility days after the attack, while evacuation efforts of the facility are on-going. With over 3,000 migrants held at such detention facilities in and around Tripoli, the frequent airstrikes on Tripoli as part of the LNA\u2019s offensive to gain control of the city raises serious safety concerns.\n\nIn Mali, inter-communal violence between Dogon and Fulani communities persisted this week, as Fulani communities were targeted in a series of attacks in central Mali. Four Fulani villages were attacked on June 30th by suspected Dan Na Ambassagou militias. In the Fulani village of Saran, 25 civilians were reportedly killed. The militia proceeded to also set fire to homes and attack livestock in the nearby villages of Bidi and Sankoro. On the same day, a Dan Na Ambassagou militia attacked Gono village, killing four Fulani civilians. A ceasefire was signed by some elements of the Dan Na Ambassagou and Sekou Bolly, the leader of a Fulani militia, in Sevare on July 1st. However, it seems unlikely to be upheld, as communal attacks in the region continued throughout the week.\n\nIn Sudan, protests occurred throughout the country for the \u2018Millions March\u2019 on June 30 th. While many cities experienced peaceful protests, security forces violently intervened in demonstrations in several cities. In Omdurman, at least five people were killed as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), along with police, violently attacked demonstrators. The following day, three bodies were discovered in the Nile River. Despite the violent crackdown, the Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the Alliance for Freedom and Change (AFC) reached an agreement for a transitional government on July 5th. The agreement calls for a civilian and military council which will oversee a three year and three-month long transition period.",

    "text": "9097\n\nIn 2018, UNICEF reached more than 100 per cent on several of its targets in\n\nthe Humanitarian Appeal for Children (HAC): 233,966 (109 per cent) children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) received treatment at UNICEF-supported treatment centres. 3,321,767 (142 per cent) IDPs (including 1,594,448 children under 5 years) were provided with integrated primary health care services at UNICEF- supported health facilities. \u2022 At least 1,228,266 (116 per cent) conflict-affected persons were reached with WASH services.\n\nOn child protection and education: UNICEF reached 85 per cent of its planned target for providing psychosocial support services 491,918 (34 per cent) boys and girls received learning materials to improve their access to formal education.\n\nHostilities between non-state armed groups (NSAGs) and security forces increased in late December in northern Borno, leading to fresh displacements and increased humanitarian needs.\n\nUNICEF\u2019s response with partners\n\n*Total Results are cumulative, since January 2018\n\nSituation Report\n\n1-31 December 2018 4.5 million Children in need of humanitarian assistance (Humanitarian Response Plan, 7.7 million People in need of humanitarian assistance in the northeast states of Borno, Adamawa & Yobe (HRP, 2018) 6.1 million People targeted in the northeast states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (HRP, 2018) 1.81 million Internally displaced people in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe (IOM DTM Round XXV, October 2018) 175,953 Newly displaced people since February 2018 (IOM DTM Round XXIII, June 2018)\n\nUNICEF Appeal 2018 US$ 142.5 million\n\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Needs\n\nAs the year drew to a close, the total number of IDPs in 2018 peaked at 1.81 million1, up from about 1.6 million2 at the beginning of the year. New displacements of people over the course of 2018 were relatively stable, with a total of 176,000 newly displaced people in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. The last weeks of December witnessed the highest movement of people, due to increased conflict between Nigerian security forces (SF) and non-state armed groups (NSAGs), especially in northern Borno. Hostilities in Baga on 26 December and Monguno on 28 December resulted in significant fresh displacement, with new registrations at camps in Maiduguri and Monguno estimated at 44,032 people in 11 camps (10 in MMC and 1 in Monguno).\n\nWith increased IDPs, the availability of land for humanitarian response has become an increasingly urgent limitation for humanitarian partners attempting to provide shelter, construct latrines and provide safe water. In Monguno, over 10,000 persons are currently sleeping outside without any shelter, almost all camps in Maiduguri are congested and more people continue to arrive.\n\nApart from the impact that hostilities have had on the local population, they have also significantly reduced humanitarian access and increased the number of people who are beyond the reach of humanitarian assistance (particularly in Kukawa LGA) which has become completely inaccessible to aid workers since December 2018. At least 253 humanitarian workers temporarily relocated from their duty stations in November-December due to ongoing hostilities, including 113 humanitarian workers who relocated from Monguno on 29 December. Among the specific incidents that impacted on UNICEF facilities during the reporting period are the 7 December attack on Rann (Kala Balge LGA, Borno state) where the UNICEF-supported clinic was burnt, and the 24 December attack in Kukareta (Damaturu LGA, Yobe state) where the maternity section of the Kukareta health facility was burnt and medicine looted. On 24 and 26 December NSAGs also burnt down three primary schools in Kukareta and Katarko towns where 1,389 children (721 girls and 668 boys), including internally displaced children, were schooling.\n\nNeeds assessments are underway in several affected locations receiving IDPs, including Monguno. Sectors are coordinating closely with partners already on the ground in these locations, as well as with rapid response partners/actors with capacity for additional scale-up of activities. In addition, sectors and partners are working on a dry season/election plan (which was originally drafted early December but requires significant updating in relation to the latest security developments and population movements).",

Between 18 and 23 February, 186 new cases were reported in seven different provinces and in the capital N\u2019Djamena. Of particular concern is the Logone Oriental province, where 43 cases were recorded in one day alone, on 20 February. Overall, the past two weeks have seen a slow increase in weekly new cases: respectively 156 and 204 new cases per week. (WHO situation reports)\n\nEU allocates 160.000 EUR for Sudanese refugees: Since 15 January 2021, intercommunal violence led to the displacement of thousands of Sudanese people fleeing into Chad in a state of grave distress. On 24 February, the European Union (EU), through its European civil protection and humanitarian aid operations service (ECHO), allocated 160.000 EUR (105 million XAF) in humanitarian aid to Sudanese refugees who fled to Chad following intercommunal clashes. This humanitarian assistance targets more than 800 households (4.000 people) in the Assoungha and Ouara departments (Ouadda\u00ef province). This funding will allow the Chadian Red Cross to address the most pressing needs of these refugees for at least four months: shelter, health services, non-food items and water. Washable facemasks will also be distributed to fight against the propagation of COVID-19. It is expected\n\nthat the number of new refugees might increase in the coming weeks. (ECHO)\n\nADB funds an 11.5 million USD literacy project: On 24 February the Ministry of Economy, Development planning and International cooperation, and the African Development Bank signed an agreement on strengthening human capital for women and girls in the amount of almost 11.6 million USD (6.2 billion XAF). This agreement aims at improving the school environment and offer for girls\u2019 education ; strengthening the girls\u2019 quality of education and functional literacy ; and diversifying the sectors taught in the Commercial Technical High School in connection with the private sector, including the integration of practical work. This project is funded under the bank\u2019s Support to Transition Facility and will be implemented by the Chadian Ministry of Education, in cooperation with partners in the education sector, including civil society and youth. (ADB)\n\nHUMANITARIAN SITUATION\n\nThe Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator visits the East of the country. A UNHCR-led mission comprising the Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) and the Heads of Office of OCHA, UNFPA and UNHCR visited the Ouadda\u00ef province from 23 to 26 February. Due to previous Covid-19 movement restrictions, this was the first visit of the HC to the East of the country, providing an opportunity for her to meet with provincial authorities, including the Governor of the Ouadda\u00ef province and the Prefect of Adr\u00e9, as well as with humanitarian partners operating in the region. The exchanges reflected the considerable challenges afflicting the East, a region chronically affected by food insecurity and malnutrition due to the combined effect of droughts and climate change, with limited income-generating opportunities and restricted access to social services.

In Abeche, the delegation visited Abeche hospital and the Bagarine site where WFP runs a resilience project called Integrated Resilience Technologies and Training Center (INTEREST). This brings together 10 villages in the area to learn and put in practice farming practices. At the same site, UNICEF runs complementary nutrition-related activities benefiting children and pregnant women in six neighboring villages. The delegation also visited the refugee camp of Kouchaguine-Moura, which currently hosts some 8,500 Sudanese refugees, including new arrivals fleeing the recent conflict in Darfur. Discussions with representatives of the camp highlighted specific needs in health, food security, access to water and to prevent Gender-Based Violence. In a working session with UN and NGO staff, the RC/HC emphasized on the importance of respecting PSEA guidelines at all levels. She also reiterated the need to share information between all humanitarian actors in order to maintain high security standards. In the context of on-going conflict in Sudan impacting on their ability to return, the refugees underlined the importance of durable shelters, employment opportunities, capacity building and training, and access to documentation, all enabling self-sufficiency and supporting livelihoods for the future. In Farchana, the delegation visited the refugee camp, currently hosting more than 30,000 refugees, and met the",

An outbreak of vaccine-derived polio (cVDPV2) was recorded in October 2019. Since then, a total of 83 cases due to low vaccination coverage have been recorded.\n\nThe wild poliovirus was declared eradicated in Chad in June 2016, the current cases are vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2. 95 per cent of cases are children under five years and 90 per cent have not been vaccinated. A first vaccination response was provided in Mandelia (November 2019) and Mongo (February 2020). Vaccination activities were suspended in March 2020 following the adoption of COVID-19 restrictive measures in Chad, which had an impact on the roll out of humanitarian operations across provinces. Vaccination campaigns are due to resume this week. A total of 91 at-risk districts have been targeted for the response to mOPV2 in 16 provinces (Mayo Kebbi-Est, Mayo Kebbi-Ouest, Salamat, Logone Oriental, Logone Occidental,\n\nMandoul, Tandjile, Moyen Chari, Wadi Fira, Ouaddai, Sila, Kanem, Hadjer Lamis, Bahr El Gazel, Lac, Batha). The\n\nresponse targets 3,490,212 under-five children and is due to start on 12 November 2020 in Hadjer Lamis.\n\nHumanitarian partners prepare to respond to the measles epidemic. A stabilization of the measles epidemic has been observed during this period of low transmission. As of 25 October, 8,601 suspected cases of measles and 39 deaths have been notified in 100 out of 126 districts (during the same period in 2019, the tally was 25,283 suspected cases and 242 deaths). However, a period of higher transmission of the disease is expected. This is\n\nprompting the planning of a vaccination campaign in epidemic-prone health districts. Two national campaigns are envisaged, requiring funding of 3 million USD, of which 2 million are available through GAVI funds. The first campaign, from 17 to 23 December 2020, will be undertaken in 11 provinces (Mayo Kebbi-Est, Mayo Kebbi- Ouest, Logone Oriental, Logone Occidental, Mandoul, Tandjil\u00e9, Moyen Chari, Salamat, Sila, Chari Baguirmi and N'Djamena); the second campaign, from 12 to 18 January 2021, will be carried out in the remaining 12 provinces\n\n(Lac, Hadjer Lamis, Kanem, Bahr El Gazel, Batha, Ouaddai, Wadi Fira, Ennedi Est, Ennedi Ouest, Borkou, Tibesti, Gu\u00e9ra). The campaigns will be coupled with vitamin A supplements and deworming for children. The Ministry of Health and donors have invited health partners and others to provide assistance and logistical support to the measles response. The NGO Premi\u00e8re Urgence Internationale (PUI) has committed to providing logistical support in the areas where it operates. Barrier and protective measures against COVID 19 will be taken during the vaccination campaigns by teams in the field (hydroalcoholic gel, protective masks, etc.).\n\nAs of 11 November, there have been 1,578 reported cases and 100 deaths in 17 provinces. Between 8 and 11\n\nNovember, there have been 31 new cases: one in Logone occidental, three in Logone oriental, three in N\u2019Djamena, three in Mayo-Kebbi ouest, nine in Moyen-Chari and 12 in Mayo-Kebbi est. Except for one, all new cases between those dates are contact cases which could indicate the difficulty in applying barrier measures in\n\ncertain areas. Moyen-Chari and Mayo-Kebbi est are the most affected provinces in the country with respectively\n\n196 and 127 reported cases since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nPOPULATION DISPLACEMENTS\n\nAdditional deportation of 54 people from Libya: On 9 November, 54 people including eight women, two girls and two boys, arrived in the town of Ounianga Kebir, located near the Libyan border. Upon arrival, these individuals were placed in quarantine, in accordance with measures taken by the Chadian authorities to prevent\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.",

At the state level, the NCS Branches worked closely with the SMOH and other participating stakeholders to provide\n\nregular operational updates and ensure a coordinated response. In Katsina state, where new cases were recorded, the\n\nNRCS Branch in Katsina mobilized 651 volunteers to support mass vaccination campaign in 20 LGAs. Also, 200 volunteers already working on the CDC funded project on Community Surveillance of AFP and priority IDRS diseases including yellow fever, were mobilized to intensify the surveillance activities.\n\nSome 150 volunteers were trained and deployed in Bauchi to support the Yellow Fever operation in four LGAs (Alkaleri, Bauchi, Tafawa Balewa & Kirfi). Through the National Society (NRCS)\u2019s grass root presence and wide range of community-based volunteers, the NRCS trained and mobilised these community-based volunteers to carry out social mobilisation activities, case detection and community engagement for behavioural change. Across the targeted states, NRCS provided capacity building on Community Engagement and Accountability (CEA) for the volunteers to ensure that CEA elements are mainstreamed into all the activities to promote community participation, effective communication, and accountability.\n\nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement in country\n\nOverview of non-RCRC actors in country\n\n2 | P a g e\n\nMDRNG027 \u2013 Nigeria Yellow Fever \u2013 DREF Final report\n\nOn 16 October 2019, the NCDC deactivated the EOC following reports that showed that the outbreak was within control and had been contained in some of the high-risk states. After the deactivation of the EOC, a new report (posted on\n\n3 November 2019) in the Daily Post, captioned: \u201cAnother suspected YF outbreak kills 6 in Bauchi\u201d surfaced with\n\nSome of the major challenges identified at the EOC included: low index of suspicion of yellow fever among health care providers; low but improving routine immunisation coverage in the states; poor documentation of yellow fever surveillance in many health facilities and across states. On this note, the NCDC requested that the Red Cross should scale up risk communication activities to include Ningi LGA and Katsina state to reach the security compromised areas with preventive messages on YF. With zero reports from Kirfi and Tafawa Balewa LGAs two weeks after implementation, NRCS scaled down activities in these two LGAs to include only community clean up campaigns. With the remaining resources, the NRCS mobilised 20 volunteers to conduct 10 days of health education, community clean up campaigns and mobile cinema activities in high risk settlements of Ningi LGA where new cases were reported. A team of five, trained on mobile cinema were deployed to Ningi to support the mobile cinema shows and provide technical support to the volunteers.

IOM also continue to provide targeted protection assistance, undertake activities for GBV response and prevention, and the inclusion of persons with disabilities.\n\nIn collaboration with the Protection Cluster, IOM\u2019s Protection team in Wau supported two protection assessments in Mapel and Macongo Bas in Jur River. IOM\u2019s Protection team continue to utilize the twin-track approach to support persons with disabilities by advocating for mainstreaming disability inclusion, including the provision of targeted protection assistance to persons with disabilities, and working with Organizations for Persons with Disabilities. In partnership with the Jubek State Union of Visually Impaired Persons and the South Sudan Association of Visually Impaired Persons, IOM supported mobility orientation training and provision of assistive devices to persons with visual impairment. In addition, IOM continued targeted protection assistance for\n\nthe flood-affected communities in the Abyei Administrative Area, which included referrals for shelter and medical assistance, as well as assistance for access rights.\n\nFurthermore, IOM supported Organizations for Persons with Disabilities in Wau and Juba with capacity building on COVID-19 messaging, including supporting them to conduct radio shows around the need for inclusion of persons with disabilities in the COVID-19 response. In addition, IOM provided face masks, buckets, and soap to support persons with disabilities with infection, prevention, and control.\n\nGender Based Violence\n\nSkills building session for women taking part in the Women and Girls\u2019 Friendly Space programme in Hai Baraka, Juba \u00a9 IOM 2020 / Nabie LOYCE\n\nIOM\u2019s women and girls\u2019 friendly space continued to provide information on access to health and other relevant services in Juba. In collaboration with national partner, Active Youth Agency (AYA), IOM registered 110 women and girls for skills-building activities, including face mask production, food cover making, and baking. During the skill-building sessions, awareness- raising was conducted before the practical session on topics including GBV, WASH, reproductive health, and COVID-19 prevention.\n\nIOM conducted two GBV assessments in Kajo Keji and Abyei to map existing GBV services on the ground, including health sector responses to GBV. Gaps identified include lack of trained health personnel to respond to GBV incidents, lack of medication for case management, and weak coordination between health\n\npartners, which limits the survivors\u2019 access to life-saving interventions. Following this assessment, IOM conducted a three-day training for 13 health partner staff (3 women, 10 men) in Abyei to address the gaps identified.\n\nThrough GBV awareness raising activities conducted in Juba with AYA, and in Wau by the IOM GBV team, a total of 4,635 individuals (1,554 women, 1,178 girls, 895 men, and 1,008 boys) were engaged through hygiene promotion and COVID-19 prevention messages. AYA also conducted four live radio talk show programmes on 88.4 City FM in Juba County on available GBV services and how to access them and discussed different types of violence. To mark Menstrual Hygiene Day on 28 May, AYA conducted a campaign encouraging men and boys to understand menstrual hygiene and break taboos on menstruation. Through this event, 232 individuals (117 women, 68 girls, 42 men, 5 boys) were engaged in changing harmful social norms and practices related to menstrual hygiene and on advocating for accessibility to hygiene products for women and girls.",

    "text": "53753\n\nThe next Strategic Situation Report will be released on 11 March\n\nSituation Overview: UPDATED pandemic is affecting 192 countries with more than 112 million confirmed cases globally, as of 25 February. WHO reports\n\nMOPH Figures: As of 25 February, MoPH data shows that 55,693\n\n2,441 people have died \u2013 at least 91 of whom are healthcare workers. Only 293,649 people out of a population of 40.4 million have been tested. Afghanistan now has a test-positivity-rate \u2013\n\npositive tests as a percentage of total tests \u2013 of close to 17 per cent,\n\naccount for 67 per cent of the total COVID-19 confirmed cases in the\n\nStigma is considered a major factor in people choosing not to get tests\n\nSource: MoPH\n\npreventative measures even more important.\n\nAlmost 8 per cent of the total confirmed COVID-19 cases are among healthcare staff and they will be the highest priority for vaccination. There is urgent need to ensure continued distribution of medical and protective equipment to all corners of the country. While 22 laboratories are now operating in Afghanistan \u2013 with plans to scale up to at least one laboratory\n\nper province by June 2021 \u2013 the capacity of these facilities remains limited and stocks of supplies have periodically run fully utilised. Humanitarian partners urge the Government to ensure laboratories are appropriately equipped, staff receive\n\ntimely remuneration and that procured supplies go to under-resourced health centres in a transparent manner so that\n\nVaccination: The Government of Afghanistan and the UN have initiated a number of steps to prepare for the rollout of\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines across the country, including the development of a National Vaccine Deployment Plan (NVDP). A technical working group comprised of government and UN organisations and chaired by MoPH has developed plans for\n\nvaccine operations, cold chain management, communication, surveillance, training and monitoring and evaluation/data,\n\nand will complement the existing Vice Presidential COVID-19 Task Force. On 7 February, Afghanistan received 500,000\n\ndoses (one person requires two doses to have a complete course) of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine from India - the first vaccine supplies Afghanistan has received to date. The vaccination campaign was launched on Tuesday, 23 February and has as of 25 February had started reaching people in 27 provinces across the country. A small buffer of\n\nabout five per cent of the total number of available doses procured through the COVAX facility has been earmarked for humanitarian caseloads although details on how the logistics costs of distribution will be managed are still under discussion. The first batch of COVID-19 vaccinations through the COVAX facility \u2013 consisting of 468,000 doses \u2013 is\n\nanticipated to arrive during the first week of March. UNICEF will be notified in the coming days about the total allocation of doses to Afghanistan through the COVAX facility for the first half of 2021. Further discussions are also underway with China on potential donation of additional vaccines. To support the vaccination campaign, UNICEF has developed and\n\nprinted registration (vaccine card, recording and reporting formats) and communication material for some 1.5 million\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is to mobilize and coordinate effective and principled humanitarian action in partnership with national and international actors.\n\nUpdate: COVID-19 | 2\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine doses. In addition to registration and communication material, UNICEF has distributed vaccines, syringes and safety boxes to all 34 provinces.\n\nSocio-economic impacts: The socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 have translated into a dramatic deterioration in food insecurity with levels now similar to those seen during the 2018 drought. An estimated 16.9 million people are in\n\ncrisis or emergency levels of food insecurity through until March and the next food security analysis is expected to be available in April. The current climate outlook is also worrying with reduced precipitation and higher temperatures potentially affecting farmers and pastoralists, as well as water availability over the next few months.

Tripoli has established two additional laboratories to supporting COVID-19 testing and is upgrading two more. This will bring the total number of laboratories in Tripoli to five. The NCD has distributed 15 GeneXpert machines and several PCR machines. However, the cartridges needed to operate the GeneXpert machines are in critically short supply (only enough to test 2500 samples). 100 and 200 PCR test kits and 24 000 and 26 000 collection tubes have been distributed to Tripoli and Benghazi, respectively.\n\nPillar 6: Infection prevention and control\n\nPillar 7: Case management o The following hospitals and other facilities are ready to admit COVID-19 patients: \u27a2 Tripoli ophthalmological hospital (69-bed capacity). \u27a2 Ibn-Aouf battleship (50 isolation beds). \u27a2 Surman teaching hospital (6 isolation beds and 4 ICU beds). o The municipalities of Zintan, Nalut, Yefren, Sabha and Gharyan have received PPE and medical supplies from the MoH and are in the process of establishing isolating facilities. o A first draft of national case management guidelines has been developed with WHO\u2019s technical guidance. It is expected to be official endorsed by early May.\n\nPillar 8: Operational support and logistics o WHO will participate in the UN\u2019s recently established COVID-19 supply chain task force to provide countries with essential supplies. One of WHO\u2019s main roles will be to provide the task force with a dynamic understanding of supplies required to halt the spread of the disease. o For the PPE pillar, the demand estimations indicated that demand far outpaces currently available capacity. Multi-channel sourcing will be critical. Currently, two key sources of supply (UNICEF and WHO) were identified and agreed upon. A joint tender initiated by UNICEF and the Procurement Reference Group has been established to coordinate the PPE pipeline and there are ongoing talks to transform this into the PPE",

    "text": "45932\n\nSyrian Arab Republic National cereal balance 2020/21 marketing year (July/June)\n\nUnlike in almost every year since 2013, the annual joint FAO/WFP Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM) in the Syrian Arab Republic was not conducted in 2020 due to COVID-19-related restrictions on international and internal travel. To fill at least some of the information gaps created by the absence of the annual report and to guide humanitarian programming, this note presents the national wheat and barley balance sheet for the 2020/21\u00a0marketing year (July/June), prepared on the basis of the available information as of November 2020.\n\nIn the past years, the wheat and barley cereal balance sheet was prepared by the CFSAM team upon completion of the work in the field. Parameters determining the balance sheet items, including the level of production and available stocks, the number of animals to determine feed needs, etc. were audited, triangulated, and in some cases, calibrated by the CFSAM team based on its direct\n\nobservations in the country. For the 2020 exercise, production figures were taken directly from the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MAAR), without any possibility of verification in situ.\n\nFavourable weather conditions, coupled with improved security conditions, led to an upturn in cereal production. The 2020 cereal harvest is estimated at 5.2 million tonnes, over 20\u00a0percent more than in the previous year and about 77\u00a0percent above the five-year average. The harvest comprised about 2.8 million tonnes of wheat (an increase of 52 percent compared to the five-year average) and 2.3\u00a0million tonnes of barley (more than double the average).\n\nThe General Establishment for Cereal Processing and Trade (Hoboob) remains the exclusive institution in charge of purchasing locally produced wheat. For the 2019/20\u00a0agricultural season, the Government\n\nallocated SYP\u00a0450 billion for domestic wheat purchases (wheat harvested by June 2020). The 2020 purchasing price for first grade wheat was originally set at SYP 225/kg with a bonus of SYP\u00a025 for delivery included. Given the sharp currency depreciation, in an effort to attract more farmers, in May 2020, the Government increased the 2020 Hoboob purchasing price to SYP 400/kg1 (equivalent to about USD\u00a0150/tonne using the exchange rate from June\u00a02020). In the past, in order to sell to Hoboob, farmers had to purchase new hessian sacks and deliver them to the collection place. The purchasing price for the same grade in 2019 was SYP 185/kg, including a bonus of SYP\u00a015/kg. In previous years, most grain purchased by Hoboob was classified in the second grade category, for which payment was slightly\u00a0less.\n\nNational wheat balance sheet\n\nThe national wheat balance sheet relies on the following assumptions:\n\nAs an official national estimate of population is not available, the balance sheet uses the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\u00a0(OCHA) estimate of 20.5 million people in\u00a02020. According to MAAR estimates, about 2.8\u00a0million tonnes of wheat were harvested in 2020 in the whole country. Opening stocks of wheat at the beginning of July 2020 were estimated at 100\u00a0000\u00a0tonnes. Per capita wheat consumption is assumed at 180 kg/annum. In the 2019 exercise, per capita wheat consumption was assumed to be 170 kg/annum. However, declining economy, weakening exchange rate and limited employment opportunities have constrained the purchasing power of the population, translating into a higher consumption of relatively accessible carbohydrates and lower consumption of proteins\n\n(meat, dairy) as well as fresh fruits and Out of 11.65 million chickens, it is estimated that about 2.7 million are fed 100 gr of At about 1.8 million hectares, the planned wheat area in the entire country for the 2021 harvest is forecast to be similar to that of\u00a02019/20. On\u00a0average, 220 kg of seeds are sown on 1\u00a0hectare. Harvest and storage losses represent 15\u00a0percent of production. Closing stocks of wheat by 30 June 2021 are estimated at 100 000 tonnes. The Government plans to import 1.3 million tonnes of wheat in the 2020/21 marketing The balance sheet does not assume any commercial imports although, as of end-November, there was no licensing requirement for traders to import wheat.",

    "text": "5442\n\nAl Hudaydah Crisis - Rapid Market Monitoring 17 - 23 June 2018\n\nIn May 2018, conflict front line in Yemen rapidly shifted north along the west coast of Yemen towards the port city of Al Hudaydah. The port of Al Hudaydah is the largest in Yemen, and along with the neighbouring port of Saleef, is the main supply point for fuel and other commodities to the north west of Yemen. The intensification of conflict is expected to disrupt supply lines between Al Hudaydah and neighbouring governorates, and to deteriorate life conditions for the Yemeni population.\n\nThis factsheet informs the humanitarian response of the supply of essential commodities in the targeted districts, by providing an overview of the data collected through the weekly Al Hudaydah Crisis Rapid Market Monitoring exercise, produced in partnership with the Cash and Market Working Group (CMWG) and several partners in the field. The graph below illustrates the price levels over time for selected commodities, using data sourced from the Joint Market Monitoring Initiative.\n\nNational median prices over time since September 2017*\n\n* The JMMI Data for June 2018 was not available at the time of writing.\n\nIt provides price levels and supply origins for essential commodities in the governorates that are serviced by Al Hudaydah Port. The data collection for this factsheet was conducted between the 17-23 June 2018 (week 25), and follows on from the first round of data collection conducted between the 10-16 June (week 24).\n\nWEEKLY FIGURES\n\n1 Participating partner 6 Districts assessed 54 Vendors surveyed\n\nEXCHANGE RATES\n\n1 US Dollar (USD) 1 US Dollar (USD) is equivalent to is equivalent to 250 Yemeni Riyal (YER) 480 Yemeni Riyal (YER) Parallel market Source: XE.com Official *\n\nASSESSED DISTRICTS\n\nASSESSED ITEMS AND SURVIVAL MINIMUM EXPENDITURE BASKET (SMEB) CONTENTS\n\n* Items not included in the SMEB\n\nPRICE MONITORING OVERVIEW FOR YEMEN\n\nMedian prices for food commodities per governorate (YER)*\n\nMedian prices for fuel and WASH commodities per governorate (YER)\n\n* NA indicates that data is not available.

As the ongoing conflict emerged in 2014, the humanitarian actors in Yemen started using cash and vouchers as a response tool to meet the immediate needs of the Yemeni population. The CMWG was established to provide a platform for discussion and setting standards and recommendations on cash and market-based responses (inclusive of cash and vouchers) for the people in need in Yemen. REACH and the CMWG began working together on joint assessments in 2017, with the publication of the Inter- Agency Joint Cash Study1, followed by the monthly Joint Market Monitoring Initiative which began in March 2018.2 In June 2018, the Al Hudaydah Crisis Rapid Market Monitoring Initiative was established by the CMWG and REACH in response to the conflict reaching the port city of Al Hudaydah, with weekly data collection from partners beginning in the week commencing 10 June 2018.\n\nThe products included in this assessment reflect the items included in the CMWG\u2019s Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB) which covers the basic needs of an average household of seven requiring immediate humanitarian assistance, and its average cost over time. The SMEB includes the following food items: wheat flour, kidney beans, vegetable oil, sugar, salt and water trucking. It also includes non-food items: soap, laundry powder, sanitary napkins and cooking fuel. Previous data on price levels for these goods has been sourced using two monthly outputs, the CMWG/REACH Joint Market Monitoring Initiative,",

    "text": "52552\n\nClimate change has been impacting the route and calendars of nomadic herders throughout Western Africa threatening the peaceful cohabitation between all involved stakeholders as competition to access natural sources fuels violence and forced displacements. At the local level, IOM supports its Member States to develop early alert mechanisms and to reinforce local conflict mitigation strategies to pre-empt the risk of conflicts associated with herds movements. At the regional level, IOM supports the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), its Member States, the regional herders' network and its national members, promoting multilateralism by ensuring that ECOWAS remains the forum where international transhumance is managed in a harmonized way.\n\nAddress the drivers and longer term impacts of crises and displacement through investments in recovery and crisis prevention\n\nFunding Required\n\nPeople Targeted\n\nEntities Targeted\n\nRO Emergency and post-crisis team\n\n1.

Insecurity and climate variability have forced shifts in the seasonal migratory routes of transhumant movements throughout West and Central Africa. The past years have seen an escalation of clashes between mobile transhumant and sedentary herder and farming communities over access to natural resources, necessitating collective action to pre- empt and mitigate the risk of persistent loss of life and livelihoods across Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Togo, leading to a hardened stance by coastal countries who opt to close their borders. These policy decisions, however, have not halted the passage of transhumant herds through the coastal countries but made these movements more opaque, while unilateral decisions from countries hinder a coherent and integrated approach.\n\nRecognising these dynamics, multiple intra-regional bodies have convened focused, policy-level discussions to formulate cohesive regional strategies to prevent further risk of tensions in their states, including ECOWAS, accompanied by the largest regional herders' network, the Billital Maroob\u00e9 Network (R\u00e9seau Billital Maroob\u00e9 in French \u2013 RBM), who meet on a regular basis to take stock of the latest transhumance campaigns, grouped along the three primary transhumance corridors. As a result of these cyclical high-level consultations, two core gaps have been highlighted. ECOWAS Member States deplored the region\u2019s lack of unified understanding of transhumant movements, their numbers and routes, and noted the direct impact this has on their ability to make sound policy decisions, and have stressed the need for localised conflict mitigation approaches to successfully address these recurrent conflicts.\n\nIn its support to its Member States and in partnership at the regional level with the RBM, IOM has developed an Early Alert System at the micro-local level, engaging local authorities, relevant line ministries and herders\u2019 representatives to pre-empt potential conflicts linked with transhumance movements across several countries in West and Central Africa. IOM also works closely with the Liptako Gourma Authority (ALG), composed of Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali's States, to identify and discuss risks and vulnerabilities in the tri-state zone, and in turn, has built working relationships with representatives of the three governments alongside national herders\u2019 associations and local authorities representing local community perspectives and the international community. IOM participates in the Ministerial Sessions of the High- Level Regional Consultation for Peaceful Transboundary Transhumance organized by ECOWAS and RBM for the Central Corridor that convenes the relevant Ministers of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Togo. The Organization will continue to coordinate with these actors to ensure complementarity and information-sharing, in an effort to promote multilateralism given the regional scale of the herders\u2019 movements and to reduce conflict associated with ungoverned transhumance. With an established presence across all countries of the Central Transhumance Corridor, IOM extends its support to its Member States on data collection and on localised conflict mitigation approaches through coordination with representatives of relevant line ministries and, where established, representatives of the National Transhumance Committees (CNT). This Crisis Response Plan will target Senegal, Guinea, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and the Central African Republic which all face challenges associated with transhumance.",

    "text": "161\n\nYemen Humanitarian Bulletin | 2\n\nThe number of people in need does not include additional needs that were created by the three-week blockade imposed by the Saudi-led Coalition on commercial imports bound to the Red Sea ports of Saleef and Al Hudaydah in November 2017, and the week of intense fighting in the capital, Sana\u2019a, in early December.\n\n10 per cent of all Yemenis have been displaced in the last 30 months\n\nArmed clashes, airstrikes and localised attacks on civilians have taken a devastating toll on the people of Yemen and generated widespread protection needs. About 12.9 million people need assistance to protect their safety, dignity or basic rights, from violations of International Humanitarian Law, grave violations of children\u2019s rights and gender-based violence. From October 2016 to September 2017, almost 8,900 conflict-related incidents, including airstrikes, armed clashes and shelling, were reported throughout Yemen \u2013 of which 82 per cent occurred in five governorates: Taizz, Sa\u2019ada, Al Jawf, Hajjah, and Sana\u2019a. More than 10 per cent of all Yemenis have experienced the shock of displacement due to conflict in the last 30 months.\n\nMost of those who have been displaced are struggling to cope because prolonged violence has brought the economy to its knees, exacerbated pre-existing vulnerabilities, degraded community resilience and accelerated the collapse of public institutions. Imports and internal movement of goods have become more difficult due to security- related restrictions, with enterprises reducing operating time by a half and laying off more than half of the workforce.\n\nAccess to services severely disrupted by continuing conflict\n\nOnly 50 per cent of health facilities in 16 governorates are functional, but lack supplies or are manned by health workers who have not received salaries for months. An estimated 16.4 million people require assistance to obtain healthcare \u2013 of whom 9.3 million are in acute need.\n\nStatus of health facilities\n\nSource: WHO, MoH; Service availability and health facilities functionality in 16 governorates (Oct. 2016)\n\nEducation has been disrupted and two million children are out of school. The discontinuation of the payment of teacher salaries has created an education crisis, risking a generation of illiterate children if no mitigation measures are put in place. UNICEF reports that between March 2015 and November 2017, out of 16,000 schools, around 256 schools were reportedly destroyed, 1,413 schools were partially damaged due to airstrikes or shelling while 150 schools were occupied by IDPs and 23 by armed groups. Teachers across the country have not been regularly paid salaries for more than a year.\n\nIn most areas of Yemen, WASH systems have been severely disrupted due to shortages hygiene facilities. Inadequate access to water and proper sanitation contributed to a spike\n\nYemen Humanitarian Bulletin | 3\n\non the achievements made in 2017 in refining the methodology for multi-cluster analysis and response, the response will strategically target populations in acute need or at risk of slipping into acute need at the district level.\n\nVulnerable areas where the risk of famine, disease outbreak and protracted displacement for IDPs, returnees and host communities converge will be prioritised through an integrated response to address humanitarian needs in a more effective and sustainable manner. Additionally, the 2018 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan\u2019s (YHRP) strategy is to work with national institutions to prevent their collapse, support resilience and livelihoods, and ensure the humanitarian-development continuum. The priority is to strengthen partnerships between national and international partners and systematically engage in capacity-building. Currently, 153 humanitarian partners are working in Yemen including 109 national NGOs, 36 international NGOs and eight UN agencies.\n\nThe importance of keeping all Yemen\u2019s ports open and functional\n\nIt is critical that the parties to the conflict keep all points of entry open",

    "text": "31854\n\nUPDATE No 8 SITUATION/CONTEXT INFORMATION .\n\nOn 14 April, the government decreed 11 different infractions and fines to the measures taken during the state of emergency. If these fines are ignored, civil-law sanctions will apply, namely travel ban, and the use of notary services. GTRM partners will follow up on consequences for refugees and migrants. On 15 April, the National Institute of Civil Defense (INDECI for its acronym in Spanish) was authorized to establish criteria to determine vulnerable populations and provide food assistance accordingly. GTRM partners consider this as an opportunity to advocate for information sharing between the Superintendence for Migration (SNM) Vulnerability Unit and the INDECI. The unit has a national database of 90,000 Venezuelan nationals holding the calidad migratoria de vulnerabilidad that could benefit INDECI\u2019s activities. On 16 April, following the heightening of gender-based violence, the municipality of Lima announced the establishment of the \u201cCasa de la Mujer\u201d, a temporary safe shelter for women facing violence during the emergency and their respective families. Through partners advocacy, the Ministry of Health (MINSA) included the Temporary Stay Permit (PTP) as valid documentation for Venezuelan health professionals wanting to support in the health emergency Some 100 Venezuelan doctors joined the efforts at the National Police hospital to support police officers and their families during the COVID-19 emergency.\n\nKEY IMPACTS, NEEDS AND RISKS .\n\nPartners and authorities reported increased gender-based violence and child abuse during the state of emergency. While some persons can be relocated to prevent further violence, most vulnerable refugees and migrants have no choice but to stay where they are due to the lack of resources and available shelter.\n\nFood security and housing remain the key needs expressed by refugees and migrants through hotlines. On\n\n15 April, media reported a Venezuelan family was evicted at gunpoint for not being able to pay rent. Partners and media reported refugees and migrants increased interest on returning to Venezuela as the result of the lack of access to food and affordable housing.\n\nAccess to health remains challenging. Only 10 per cent of refugees and migrants from Venezuela have regular yet limited access to the public health system.\n\nRESPONSE .\n\nOPERATIONAL MEASURES 1. So far, USD 452,000 have been distributed on CBI to support more than 11,000 refugees and migrants across Peru. Distributions focused mainly in Lima and in Arequipa, Callao, Cusco, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Madre de Dios, Piura, Tacna and Tumbes.\n\nFollowing GTRM partners advocacy next to the Ombudsperson\u2019s office regarding refugees and migrants\u2019 impossibility to denounce labour issues, the National Superintendence of Labour Inspection (SUNAFIL) has included the PTP and the asylum seeker card as valid documentation in their platform. Some 4,000 persons, including refugees and migrants, have joined in live online workshops. Activities such as yoga, arts and music are made available by Peruvian and Venezuelan volunteers during the quarantine as part of the campaign #TuCausaEsMiCausa.\n\nKEY FIGURES\n\nREFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ASSISTED.",

Ebola virus disease outbreak in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 22 February 2021. ECDC: Stockholm; 2021. \u00a9 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Stockholm, 2021\n\nTHREAT ASSESSMENT BRIEF\n\nEbola virus disease outbreak in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nEvent background\n\nOn 7 February 2021, an Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak was declared by the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), in the North Kivu province in the eastern part of the country [1]. This province was recently affected by the largest outbreak of EVD ever recorded in DRC [2]. That tenth EVD outbreak occurred in the eastern part of the country from August 2018 until 25 June 2020, affecting the Kivu and Ituri provinces, where these most recent cases have been detected, and resulted in 3 470 cases, including 2 287 deaths [3].\n\nSince the beginning of this outbreak and as of 18 February 2021, four confirmed cases of EVD, including two deaths, have been reported in the North Kivu province, in two health zones: Biena (two cases) and Katwa (two cases) [4,5]. Additionally, media sources quoting health authorities report of two further cases detected on 18 February 2021, in the Katwa and Mangurudjipa health zones [6].\n\nThe first confirmed case of EVD was in a patient who sought treatment for Ebola-like symptoms at two healthcare facilities between the 25 January and 3 February in the Biena health zone. On 3 February she was referred to a Hospital in the Katwa health zone, where her condition further deteriorated and she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where she eventually died on 4 February. The case was married to an EVD survivor, whose biological samples tested negative twice since 28 September 2020. A further three cases were reported, two of whom were reported to have had contact with the first reported case, with one of these two being a vaccinated healthcare worker who had treated the first case, and was reported to be themselves a case on 14 February in the Katwa health zone. Both cases who died were reportedly buried in the traditional way without safety precautions.\n\nAccording to media sources, the so-called \u2018Ituri strain\u2019 has been identified in this outbreak. This strain was circulating in regions in North Kivu during the tenth EVD outbreak (2018-2020) in the DRC [7].\n\nIn recent years, the DRC has been affected by several EVD outbreaks. The eleventh outbreak of EVD in the DRC was declared on 1 June 2020 and took place on the western side of the country in the Equateur Province [8]. It culminated in 130 cases including 55 deaths and was declared over by the Minister of Health on 18 November 2020 [9].\n\nNorth Kivu Provincial health authorities are currently leading the response and are supported by WHO and the DRC Ministry of Health. The cases are being investigated by WHO epidemiologists on-site, and so far more than 300 contacts have been identified [7]. A vaccination campaign was launched on 15 February 2021 in Butembo. Hospital staff of the Matanda Hospital, where the first detected case received treatment, were the first to receive the vaccine [10].\n\nTHREAT ASSESSMENT BRIEF Ebola virus disease outbreak in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo Figure 1. Geographical distribution of confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases in DRC, 2021\n\nRisk assessment questions\n\nWhat is the risk for EU/EEA citizens living in or travelling to affected areas in DRC to be affected by the current outbreak of EVD? What is the risk of the introduction and spread of the Ebola virus circulating in North Kivu, DRC within the\n\nECDC risk assessment\n\nIn this document, the risk was assessed following ECDC\u2019s rapid risk assessment methodology [11].\n\nThese EVD cases are the first ones of the disease reported in North Kivu, DRC since the tenth outbreak was declared over in June 2020 [12]. The source of infection of the first human case in this epidemic is currently unknown. The virus is known to persist in a very low percentage of survivors for more than two years, and transmission might have occurred through contact with a virus carrier survivor of the previous epidemic in North Kivu. However, a spill-over event from an animal reservoir cannot be totally excluded.",

    "text": "35865\n\nTracking Mobility Impact - Points of Entry Analysis Quarterly Report on Points of Entry in MENA Region (April 2020 - June 2020)\n\nThe current outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted global and regional mobility in the form of various travel disruptions and mobility restrictions adopted since the declaration of global pandemics by WHO on March 11th, 2020. To track and better understand how COVID-19 affects global mobility, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) has developed a global mobility database to monitor the status and mobility and visa restrictions at Points of Entry (PoE), together with preparedness and response measures in place to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response in line with International Health Regulations (IHR).\n\nPoints monitored include airports, land border crossing points (road or rail), sea border crossing (sea, river or lake) ports of entry and exit and other locations that are not analysed in this document as internal transit points and areas of interest. This Report describes the findings from data collected between 23 April and 25 June 2020, on 206 official ports of entry across the region1, including 98 land border crossings points, 66 airports and 42 blue border crossing points2. This work is based on the information collected by IOM Country offices in the Middle East and North Africa- see Methodology Section at the end of the report.\n\nThis information is meant to serve IOM member states, IOM and its UN partner agencies in responding adequately, and in a targeted manner, to the current and evolving crisis period. This is also in regard to the eventual transition to a regular operational mode, once the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis is over.\n\nThe structure of the report is as follows: Page 2 presents the main data on the COVID-19 cases and other medical dimensions of the pandemics in the region, Page 3 shows the main findings relative to the country level restrictions, Pages 4, 5 and 6 reports the main trends for the three Ports of Entry- international airports, land border crossing points and blue border crossing points- monitored in the region. Page 7 presents an In Focus on Affected Population - Stranded Migrants and page 8 reports briefly the Methodology used to collect the data presented in this Quarterly Report.\n\nOverview of monitored International Airports, Land border crossing points and Blue border crossing points in MENA\n\nNotes: 1- The number of PoEs varies from 160 in Round 1, 196 in Round 3, 204 in Round 5, and 206 in Round 10. 2- This analysis focuses on the official Points of Entry (PoE) in the countries; nevertheless, we acknowledge the presence of at least 27 unofficial Points of Entry in the region, consisting of 22 land border crossing points and 5 blue border crossing points.\n\nMedical Situation A total of 608,063 cases have been confirmed with 9,740 deaths reported as of 30th June 2020 since the first case of COVID 19 was reported in the IOM Middle East and North Africa region in United Arab Emirates. A total of 401,631 people has recovered. The case fatality rate is at 1.6%\n\nThe progression of the disease in the region was initially very slow and it picked up in May, and the number of cases doubled and tripled within a very short period. It took the region 96 days to reach the 100,000 mark for number of cases. It now takes a shorter period to achieve the same milestone: 15 days to reach the second 100,000 cases, 12 days to reach the third 100,000 cases, 10 days to reach fourth 100,00 cases, 9 days to reach the fifth 100,000 cases and 8 days to reach the sixth 100,000 cases.\n\nIn terms of disease transmission, countries are at different stages. Algeria, UAE, Syria, Qatar, Oman, Yemen, and Sudan are all experiencing community transmission, while Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Morocco, Kuwait, Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, and Libya are all reporting cluster of cases. Tunisia is experiencing sporadic cases.\n\nDisease transmission in the region remains very active with the number of daily cases still increasing. Mini peaks are observed after every 7 days. The number of deaths reported is still high and stability is yet to be achieved.",

The findings of this assessment are meant to provide an accurate portrayal of the realities on the ground but should be considered as generalizations more broadly of the overall and immediate circumstances and issues facing the\n\ncommunities where respondents were interviewed.\n\nAnother limiting factor is that, in the interests of a timely deployment and due to limited availability of resources for conducting this assessment, field teams did not engage in deeper investigation through focus groups or semi- structured qualitative interviews. However, ACTED has relied on some of the general observations from field team members / ACTED Program staff to provide additional contextual references with regard to the overall findings\n\nACTED DROUGHT NEEDS ASSESSMENT \u2013 SOOL, SANAAG AND TOGDHEER, FEB 2021\n\nPOPULATION MOVEMENT: Respondents\u2019 feedback regarding population movements indicated a strong upward trend in new arrivals at the assessed sites, with 71% of respondents\n\nmentioning that there was in increase in the number of arrivals over the past three (3) months, while only 41% found that households had left the sites.\n\nThe primary reason for displacement was given as \u201closs of livelihood due to drought\u201d (65.3%, see Graph 1 at right).\n\nSites ranged in size from several dozen to a few hundred, and several thousand households. The sites visited under this Drought Needs Assessment represent a population of over 13,000 households (approximately 80,000 individuals). Respondents saw the number of residents leaving the camps as being more proportional to the size of the camp. Households leaving could range from a few dozen to several hundred depending on the location.\n\nRespondents in Aynabo, Badhan, Burao districts also observed that new camps were being created to deal with the influx of newly displaced households. However, respondents viewed that these new camps (named: Alla-Amin, Ceeg and \"15\") generally as being underequipped and with significant water needs.\n\nGraph 2: Level of Deterioration of Food Security in the Past 3 Months\n\n72% 75% 33% 33% 33% 33% 31%\n\nBadhan Buhodle Burao Dhahar Elafwayn Erigavo Garadag Hudun\n\n% of Total\n\nNo Change\n\nFOOD SECURITY:\n\nGenerally, respondents (60%) seemed to anticipate that the food security situation would not improve in the coming 1-3 months, either significantly deteriorating (36%), or showing some deterioration (24%). However, a larger proportion felt that the food security situation would largely stay the same in the coming 1-3 months as opposed to the previous 3 months.\n\nMost respondents felt that within the previous one month (78%), as well as over the past three months (93%) the food security situation deteriorated either significantly or slightly (see Graph 2 above), but that there was a marked consideration across the districts that by-and-large the availability and accessibility of food was strained. Furthermore, there was also significant feedback regarding the observation of continued food price inflation making it more difficult to purchase foods in addition to unavailability or shortages of many common staples\u201461% of respondents observed that prices had increased compared with the previous month.\n\nGrand Total 4.2% Erigavo 8.3% Burao 3.7% Badhan 5.6% 11.1%",

    "text": "9573\n\nAs more people become displaced due to ongoing conflict, northeast Nigeria remains in a humanitarian crisis stemming from the threats made by Boko Haram. A lack of state presence has allowed criminal networks to operate freely for decades, however since the emergence of the Islamist militia nine years ago there have been countless insurgencies, forcing households to leave their homes and relocate to camps and host communities for IDPs. More recently, this displacement has been exacerbated by clashes between semi-nomadic cattle herders, mostly of Fulani ethnicity, and sedentary farmers.\n\nThe Fulani herdsmen have historically grazed their cattle in the area of the Lake Chad basin however the landlocked lake has shrunk from 22,000 square kilometres in the 1960s to fewer than 1,500 today due to changing climate patterns. This has forced the herdsmen to migrate southwards, triggering disputes with farmers. It has also been observed that religion has played a part in the conflict between the herdsmen and the farmers, as the former are predominantly Muslim, whilst the latter are Christian. Significant challenges facing Nigeria pertain to ongoing conflicts, and are exacerbated by poverty, climate change and underdevelopment. It is therefore necessary that the Nigerian government cooperate with humanitarian organisations to ensure one hundred percent of aid is received by those affected, and to eventually reach a solution to the complex situation.\n\nLatest Developments in Nigeria\n\nElection News\n\nConflict and the Threat of Boko Haram in North-Eastern States The relentless Boko Haram insurgency continues to displace thousands in the northeast of Nigeria. On the 29th January, the UN claimed that the threat displaced 30,000 people alone in the town of Rann. Other reports claim four people have been killed and two abducted in Borno State, with 8 soldiers confirmed dead in Yobe state. It is estimated 15,000 people have attempted to escape to Cameroon and Chad. In December, the army targeted Amnesty International and UNICEF, among other humanitarian aid agencies and journalists, accusing them of training \u201cspies\u201d to support Boko Haram insurgents. The military claimed that UNICEF had held workshops in Maiduguri training people for \u201cclandestine\u201d activities that were \u201csabotaging\u201d counter- terrorism efforts. The ban has since been lifted.\n\nIntercommunal Violence in the Middle-Belt Region\n\n\uf0d8 Amnesty International blamed the failure of the Nigerian authorities to investigate communal clashes and bring perpetrators to justice for the escalation of violence between farming communities and Fulani herdsmen. Amnesty estimates that the conflict has cost 3,600 lives over the course of three years, with 2018 being the worst on record. 300,000 people have been displaced since conflicts were renewed in the Middle-Belt region. Speaking in Jos, Plateau State during a campaign stop, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) described how insecurity in the Middle Belt has affected Nigeria, remarking: \"Plateau is the economic hub of the Middle Belt, but insecurity has, over the years, forced it to lose that status.\"\n\nTimeline of Events December 2018 Amnesty releases report highlighting communal violence in the Middle-Belt region UNICEF is temporarily banned as President Buhari expresses concerns over false claims of allegiance to Boko Haram.

    "text": "5637\n\nRegional update\n\nThe deepening political and socio-economic crisis in Venezuela has led to one of the biggest mass displacements in the history of South America. Although no consolidated figure for the region is available, all sources indicate that migration from Venezuela to neighbouring countries is drastically increasing. 117,300 Venezuelans filed asylum claims in the first half of 2018 alone, already more than the number of asylum claims reported at the end of 2017 (113,438).\n\nMany Venezuelans in host countries are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Food, nutrition, health and WASH needs have been identified. Protection assistance is also crucial, including legal help with documentation in order to access healthcare and employment. Venezuelan migrants also face growing xenophobia from host communities, and are at risk of exploitation, trafficking, and\n\nAs the crisis inside Venezuela continues to deteriorate, host countries are increasingly struggling to respond to the influx of Venezuelans. The rising number of people entering neighbouring countries is putting a strain on basic services, especially in border areas. Recent measures in several countries deter Venezuelans from entering, such as limiting admission to people with a passport, or enforcing quotas at the border.\n\nShort note \u2013 5 September 2018\n\nAny questions? Please contact our senior analyst, Jude Sweeney js@acaps.org/ +41 78 783 48 25\n\nOverview of the current situation\n\nIn August 2018, as the influx of Venezuelans continued to increase, neighbouring countries began implementing stricter entry restrictions or making it harder to apply for legal status.\n\nThe regional response to the Venezuelan influx has, for the most part, been reactive rather than proactive, with countries applying unilateral strategies to deal with the migration from Venezuela. However, ambassadors from Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru met from 27 August to 4 September in Bogota to devise joint efforts to address the crisis. (EBC 28/08/2018) Representatives gave an overview of Venezuelan immigration in their country and the impact in terms of health, education, work, and protection. They reaffirmed the importance of cooperating to establish basic common principles. (Ministerio de Relationes Exteriores Colombia 31/08/2018)\n\nRecent developments\n\nBetween 6 April and 8 June 2018, the Colombian government carried out a mass registration of Venezuelans living in Colombia (the RAMV \u2013 Ejercicio masivo de registro para los venezolanos). 442,462 people were registered, more than 89% of whom stated their intention to stay in Colombia. 27% of registered Venezuelans were children, of whom only 49% were enrolled in Colombia\u2019s education system. Only 1% of all registered were enrolled in Colombia\u2019s health system. (UNHCR 03/08/2018; 16/07/2018) The report stated that registered Venezuelans would ultimately be regularised and be able to access basic services. (Government of Colombia 13/06/2018) However, there was no detailed plan or timeframe given for when this will happen.\n\nMore than 60% of Venezuelans in Colombia are in an irregular situation, which not only prevents them from accessing basic services, but also prevents them from working in the country. (UNHCR 03/08/2018). In June 2018, 376,572 Venezuelans had a regular status in Colombia, and only 181,472 of them had a PEP (Permiso Especial de Permanencia) a permit granting them the rights to reside and work in Colombia for two years. (Government of Colombia 13/06/2018) On 2 August, only a few days before his mandate ended, President Juan Manuel Santos granted PEPs to more than 442,000 additional Venezuelans. (Al Jazeera 09/08/2018, UNHCR 03/08/2018)\n\nColombia\u2019s new president, Iv\u00e1n Duque, took office on 7 August. It is unclear what his plans are to address the situation. In April 2018, he suggested that Colombia should take steps to recognise Venezuelan university degrees and offer temporary work permits without\n\nACAPS Briefing Note: Venezuela - Regional update",

    "text": "4389\n\n21 - 29 June 2018\n\nUNHCR FLASH UPDATE\n\nOn 27 June, UNHCR and the UN Migration Agency (IOM), published a joint statement in which they expressed deep concern regarding the loss of lives of almost 1,000 refugees and migrants while being smuggled across the Mediterranean. UNHCR and IOM are appealing to European Union countries for concerted, region-wide actions to reduce needless loss of life at sea. UNHCR and IOM believe that the disembarkation of people rescued at sea can be tackled through a collaborative effort that would make these operations more predictable and manageable. The approach needs to be complemented by more resettlement places, family reunification and other solutions within the EU, and increased support to countries where people are disembarked. In light of the recent events where vessels on the Mediterranean Sea carrying refugees and migrants where unable to dock in Europe, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi stated that it is absolutely crucial to uphold the right to asylum in EU member States. Grandi also said that denying rescue, or shifting responsibility for asylum elsewhere is completely unacceptable. Population Movements The number of individuals disembarked in Libya has increased dramatically during the reporting period, with rescue/interception operations taking place almost on a daily basis. As of 28 June, the LCG rescued/intercepted more than of 10,000 refugees and migrants. During the week, some 2,425 refugees and migrants were disembarked in Al Khums (459 individuals), Tajoura (86 individuals) and at the Tripoli Naval base (1,880 individuals). The highest number was recorded on 24 June, when 947 individuals were disembarked in Tripoli. On 29 June, at least 100 people died after a boat carrying around 123 refugees and migrants sank off the coast of Tajoura in Libya. UNHCR and its partner International Medical Corps were present at disembarkation points where they provided core-relief items and vital medical assistance at disembarkation points and in detention centres to which individuals were transferred by the authorities. UNHCR Response UNHCR continues to rehabilitate the Gathering and Departure Facility (GDF) in Tripoli, to be operational by mid-July. In November, UNHCR welcomed the decision by the Libyan authorities to set up a \u201cgathering and departure facility\u201d in Tripoli for people in need of international protection. The GDF\u2019s main objective is to speed up the process of securing solutions for refugees and asylum-seekers in third countries. The facility will enable UNHCR to receive the most vulnerable persons of concern in a safe environment to process their cases for resettlement, family reunification, evacuation, or voluntary repatriation, as appropriate. At the GDF, UNHCR staff and partners will provide registration and humanitarian assistance such as accommodation, food, medical care and psychosocial support. The GDF will provide an alternative to detention for UNHCR persons of concern in Libya. It is will be managed by UNHCR and the Libyan Ministry of Interior. UNHCR is rehabilitating the premises with a view to complete phase by mid-July, accommodating 200 individuals. Once the facility is complete, it will accommodate up to 1,000 individuals in need of international protection. On 25 June, UNHCR evacuated 128 vulnerable refugees and asylum-seekers from Tripoli to UNHCR\u2019s Emergency Transit Mechanism in Niger. The group included 41 men, 57 women and 30 children from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia. This is the second evacuation taking place in June. Since November 2017, UNHCR has evacuated 1,858 individuals from Libya (1,536 to Niger, 312 to Italy and 10 to Romania). These evacuations allow for the transfer of vulnerable individuals from detention centres in Libya to a safe and dignified environment while their cases are processed for solutions such as resettlement or family reunification. As of 25 June 2018, 11 States have committed a total of 3,781 resettlement places for the Libya-Niger situation. The 11 States are: Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Out of these pledges, 1,100 will be used for resettlement processing directly out of Libya, while 2,681 places will be allocated to evacuees from Libya and refugees registered in Niger. On 21 June, UNHCR met with the Head of the local Tawergha Council to discuss the safe return of the Tawergha people after seven years of displacement across Libya. Pending return, UNHCR continues to provide humanitarian assistance to IDPs including basic assistance as core-relief items and cash-based interventions. So far in 2018, UNHCR provided cash assistance to 2,261 IDP households (12,686 individuals) and distributed non-food items to more than 31,000 IDPs and returnees in the country.",

    "text": "310\n\n3 \u2013 9 February 2018\n\nUNHCR FLASH UPDATE\n\nIn coordination with UN agencies and partners, UNHCR is responding to the needs of some 5,000 internally displaced persons (IDP) from Tawergha who recently attempted to return to their hometown. Following the Presidency Council\u2019s decree of 26 December 2017 indicating the start date for the return process, IDP families from the east, south and west of Libya attempted to return to Tawergha on 1 February. Armed groups, apparently opposing their return, blocked them from entering the city. Since then, IDPs have been gathering in the area of Qararat al Qataf (some 50 km southwest of Tawergha), in the city of Tarhuna (65 km southeast of Tripoli) and in Harawa (east of Sirte). While negotiations are ongoing for their return, local civil society organizations have reported needs for shelter, food, baby items, hygiene kits, mattresses, blankets and primary healthcare. UNHCR has led the deployment of a multifunctional team composed of UNHCR, IOM, UNICEF, WHO, LibAid and the Bani Walid Association to complete a rapid assessment. Aiming to provide some initial emergency relief, UNHCR partner LibAid has set up more than 100 tents. UNHCR teams and LibAid have delivered 2,000 blankets, 500 kitchen sets, 1,000 hygiene kits, 2,000 sleeping mats, and 200 solar lamps. UNHCR continues to monitor the situation and has set up a warehouse containing non-food items (NFIs) for emergency purposes. On 11 February, LibAid will start distributing NFIs to IDPs currently hosted in Harawa.\n\nOn 8 February, the UNHCR Representative to Libya, Roberto Mignone, visited Misrata and met with Libyan authorities, including the mayor of Misrata, partners and civil society organisations to assess the humanitarian needs of refugees, asylum-seekers, IDPs, returnees, and host communities. After this meeting, the UNHCR Representative visited an IDP settlement in the city and planned possible activities and interventions to support the population.\n\nUNHCR Response\n\nSo far in 2018, 2,039 refugees and migrants at sea were disembarked in Libya by the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG). The latest operation was conducted by the LCG on 2 February, when 94 refugees and migrants were disembarked in Al Khums. In line with recent movements, the boat departed from the area east of Tripoli near the city of Zlitan. UNHCR and its partner International Medical Corps identified persons in need of international protection and provided primary healthcare and hygiene kits to the disembarked.\n\nUNHCR\u2019s quick-impact projects (QIPs) continue to support IDPs, returnees and host communities in Libya. This week, UNHCR began the delivery of water tanks to clinics, public medical facilities and schools in the cities of Sabratha, Azzawya, Zintan, Sirte, Al Jufra, Awal and Al Awiniyah. These projects were jointly identified by UNHCR, authorities and partners. UNHCR delivered electrical heaters and NFIs to 300 IDPs in the Janzur settlement near Tripoli as part of its winterization campaign.\n\nSpecial thanks to major donors:\n\nAustralia | Denmark | European Union | Germany | Italy | The Netherlands | Norway | Sweden | Switzerland | United Kingdom\n\nKey Figures people of concern 46,730 registered refugees & asylum-seekers 180,937* internally displaced persons\n\nUNHCR Coordinated Sectors Protection Sector Shelter & NFI Sector Cash & Markets Working Group\n\nKey Achievements in 2018\n\n5,547 medical consultations ( 35,091 in 2017) 482 IDPs and refugees received non-food items (113,605 in 2017)\n\n107 IDP and refugee households received cash assistance (3,314 in 2017)\n\n10,124 individuals registered since 2016 (1,609 in 2018)\n\n1,567 rescue kits and 123 medical consultations provided at disembarkation points (5,327 and 2,956 in 2017)\n\n121 monitoring visits to detention centres (1,080 in 2017)\n\n310 detained refugees/asylum-seekers released (1,428 in 2017)\n\n1,077 refugees and asylum-seekers reached with solutions since Oct 2017: 401 resettlement referrals and 676 individuals evacuated from Libya ( 512 to Niger, 162 to Italy and 2 to Romania)",

    "text": "55207\n\nNORTH-EAST NIGERIA: Flash Update #1 Geidam LGA, Yobe State As of 1 May 2021\n\nUp to 150,000 civilians have fled Geidam town, Yobe State, after multiple attacks occurred since 23 April 2021, targeting communities and forcing almost the entire population of the town to seek safety. \u2022 Many IDPs are in transit along routes leading to neighbouring towns in northern Yobe in Yunusari, Yusufari, Muzugun, Gashua, Nguru and its state capital, Damaturu. The state government is ensuring IDPs in transit locations, and host communities are supported, while efforts continue to contain the safety and security of Geidam town. \u2022 SEMA has mobilised local authorities and community leaders in their respective LGAs to support the response. \u2022 The Governor of Yobe State summoned an Emergency Security Meeting on 27 April, attended by government members, critical stakeholders including traditional rulers, where he highlighted the increased presence of NSAGs in the state. \u2022 An inter-agency emergency coordination centre (ECC) has been established in Gashua, Bade LGA, to facilitate and monitor response operations. \u2022 Host community households, religious groups, and volunteers are providing the first line of support to the displaced persons including shelter, cooked meals, water, sleeping mats and other basic needs. A rapid assessment team from OCHA, with support from the government and partners, arrived in Gashua on 28 April to provide first-hand information on sector priorities.\n\n\u2022 23 April: Geidam was attacked by suspected Non-State Armed Group (NSAG). \u2022 29 April: Attack of Kanamma town, the administrative headquarters of Yunusari LGA, located some 35 kilometres north of Geidam town; though no civilian casualty was reported, this has raised concerns of further displacements and possible crossings of people into the neighbouring Republic of the Niger. \u2022 01 May: Second attack on Kanamma town resulting in the displacement of people of the town; efforts are on-going to confirm the number displaced.\n\nSituation Overview The attacks, which started on 23 April, were marked by sporadic shooting, targeting civilian homes and property. Most of the displaced people are still in transit across neighbouring rural communities within Geidam LGA and in nearby towns such as Yunusari and Yusufari aiming to reach and take refuge in Gashua in Bade LGA (approx. 105 kilometres), and Nguru LGA (approx. 165 kilometres), or to the state\n\ncapital of Damaturu (approx. 180 kilometres). The majority of the people moved by foot and by local\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)\n\ntransport and are stranded across transit locations where access to critical supplies and services, including food, water, shelter and medicine, is very limited. Close to 150,000 civilians have been displaced from Geidam town, capital of Geidam LGA, following repeated attacks by non-state armed group (NSAG) operatives. Host communities are sheltering IDPs in Yunusari, Yusufari and Muzugun, while some have arrived as far as in Gashua, Damaturu, Nguru and other safer LGAs.\n\nThe attacks in Geidam has occurred at a time when humanitarian partners are already challenged to\n\nrespond to over 10,000 new arrivals over the past months from Borno State and from remote communities in Yobe State fleeing conflict in their areas, still unable to return to Geidam due to insecurity. There are reports of individuals who have ventured back only to monitor and gather information about the possibility to return, however, indications from recent surveys and discussions show that the people are still suffering from trauma and fear without guaranteed safety and security in their homes. The major concerns cited by IDPs on their reluctance of returning include continued\n\npresence of NSAG operatives in the general area, large-scale destruction of homes, businesses and critical infrastructures such as hospitals and schools, and reports of IEDs and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) in parts of the affected areas.",

The already fragile health system is overstretched with additional strain from the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\nAs the crisis completes tenth year, 6.7 million people are internally displaced since the onset of the crisis; 5.6 million people have fled the country as refugees, the vast\n\nmajority to neighboring countries. Up to ninety per cent of the population is estimated to live under the poverty line, largely due to the recent severe\n\neconomic decline. This is a 10% increase compared to previous years. Displacement continues to be heavily concentrated in urban centres \u2013 where more\n\nthan 87 per cent of IDPs now reside, compounding the stress on overstretched resources, infrastructure and services.\n\nAt least 12.4 million people are in need of health assistance. The essential health service infrastructure such as hospitals and health centers are in a state of disrepair,\n\nrequiring extensive maintenance and rehabilitation to provide a minimum level of service delivery.\n\nBy the end of December 2020, out of the 113 assessed public hospitals, 50% (56) were reported fully functioning, 26% (30) hospitals were reported partially functioning (i.e. shortage of staff, equipment, medicines or damage of the building in some cases), while 24% (27) were reported non-functioning. Out of 1790 assessed public health centres, 47% (842) were reported fully functioning, 21% (373) partially functioning, 32% (575) non-functioning (completely out of service).\n\nThere is chronic shortage of health care staff driven by displacement, death, injury, and flight of health workers particular in northeast Syria.\n\nUp to 50 per cent of the health workforce is estimated to have left the country. These gaps can only be addressed with long-term investment.\n\nWHO RESPONSE PRIORITIES\n\n\u2713 Preventive activities \u2013 such as routine\n\ncommunity health promotion \u2013 remain essential in all areas of Syria including IDP and refugee camps.\n\n\u2713 Scale up the COVID-19 response across the country under all pillars except\n\n\u2713 Improving access to primary, secondary and tertiary health care services using fixed health facilities, mobile teams and outreach services\n\n\u2713 Improving the emergency referral system, as well as trauma, triage and emergency services.\n\n\u2713 Establishing and expanding specialized\n\nservices, such physical rehabilitation, malnutrition with complications, and burns care across affected populations.\n\n\u2713 Ensuring reliable supply of safe, quality\n\n\u2713 Promote integrated health service delivery to address both communicable\n\n\u2713 Expanding mental health and psychosocial support services capacity and coverage, including training of health care workers and provision of psychotropic medicines to certified\n\n\u2713 Strengthening epidemiological and laboratory surveillance systems at all\n\n\u2713 Improving infection prevention and control measures within communities and health facilities.\n\nHalf a million children are chronically malnourished and an additional 137 000 children under five years of age are suffering from acute malnutrition, heightening their exposure to preventable morbidity and mortality.\n\nNon-communicable diseases \u2013 cardiovascular diseases, injuries, cancer and diabetes, amongst others \u2013 and epidemic-prone diseases are the most common causes of morbidity in Syria. 45 per cent of all deaths in Syria are estimated to be related to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) \u2013 a 40 per cent increase when compared with 2011 rates. This rise in morbidity rates can be linked to the cumulative damage of health and WASH infrastructure in parts of the country, the lack of qualified personnel and import restrictions for key supplies and equipment, which combined have reduced the availability and accessibility of health services. Displaced persons require continuity of care for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases, diabetes, cancer, psychosocial and mental health, and as well maternal and child health services.",

The pandemic has spread to 191 countries with more than 64 million confirmed cases, as of 3 December.\n\nMOPH Figures: As of 3 December, MoPH data showed that\n\nconfirmed to have had COVID-19.

Only 154,603 people out of a population of than 30 per cent, suggesting overall under-testing of potential cases. confirmed cases in the MoPH data, although this may be the result resources and testing capacity, lack of people coming forward for testing, as well as the absence of a national death register, confirmed by MoPH are unlikely to be capturing the full scale of the situation since testing remains limited to only the most severe cases. This assumption is supported by the results of an early seropositivity study by MoPH, Johns Hopkins and WHO that estimated 30 per cent of the population had been exposed to COVID-19 by July 2020. Stigma is around. WHO warns that widespread complacency and failure to follow public health advice is creating grave risks in the\n\nSecond Wave: On 19 November, the MoPH confirmed that Afghanistan is in a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following two months of consistently lower confirmed COVID-19 cases, MoPH tracking data is starting to reflect anecdotal reports of a recent uptick in cases, with 1,768 new COVID-19 cases recorded over the past week. Furthermore, suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 are again rising in Hirat province. According to WHO, the Hirat Regional Hospital is currently operating at full capacity, prompting local authorities to ask NGO health partners to expand bed capacity for COVID-19 patients. Other COVID-19 hospitals in Kandahar and Nangarhar are also operating at full capacity. While the official numbers across the country are not yet at the same level as the May/June peak, when taken together with reports of increased hospitalisations for COVID-19-like symptoms, the need for vigilance should be reinforced. The rollout of the annual influenza vaccination across Afghanistan will be more important than ever to help the health system manage the rise in COVID-19 cases. Increasing influenza vaccine coverage can reduce the strain on the health care system and free-up limited health resources to focus on treating more severe cases of COVID-19. Public health experts strongly urge the public to follow health advice on physical distancing, mask wearing, good hygiene, hand washing and other proven strategies that mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission amid this second wave.\n\ntreat patients with COVID-19, as well as maintaining essential health services, especially in areas of active conflict. WHO stresses the need to balance the demands of responding directly to COVID-19, with simultaneously engaging in strategic planning and coordinated action to maintain essential health service delivery, mitigating against the risk of system\n\nAlmost 9 per cent of the total confirmed COVID-19 cases are among healthcare staff as of 26 November. Health facilities across the country continue to report shortfalls in PPE, medical supplies and equipment, further challenging their capacity to treat COVID-19 patients. In support of the Government, humanitarian partners have provided hundreds of thousands of pieces of PPE and several thousand items of life-saving medical equipment to MoPH. In total, since the start of the pandemic, almost 1.3 million PPE items have been delivered by humanitarian partners to both MoPH and directly to frontline NGO workers in Afghanistan. With a second wave of the gathering pace globally, there is an urgent need to ensure a rapid distribution of medical and protective equipment to all corners of the country.",

    "text": "31206\n\nFACT SHEET\n\nNorth of Central America Situation May 2020\n\nAround 470,000 refugees and asylum-seekers from the North of\n\nCentral America in the world and\n\n318,590 internal displaced people in Honduras and El Salvador have\n\nbeen forced to flee their homes because of brutal violence.\n\nAs at May, countries in the region continue to maintain official borders\n\nclosed to prevent the spread of\n\nCOVID19. Cases of violence and internal forced displacement in\n\ncountries of origin continue unabated.\n\nUNHCR and partners have been identifying and assisting people with\n\nunaccompanied children, SGBV survivors (women and LGBTI people),\n\nmen victims of recruitment witnesses of serious crimes.\n\nASYLUM SEEKERS AND REFUGEES By country of origin\n\nSource: Based on data provided by governments to UNHCR as of Dec-19.\n\nGovernments in the NCA maintain curfews and quarantine to avoid a new wave of COVID-19 infections, which continues to impact UNHCR\u2019s presence in communities and people of concern\u2019s jobs and livelihoods. These restrictions also worsen the situation for people at risk in countries of origin, who will face additional difficulties to flee when persecuted. Internal forced displacements continue despite the pandemic.\n\nLGTBI community leaders in the NCA continue to report violence and persecution by gangs that aim to force them into criminal activities or threaten their lives because of who they are. They also experience limitations in accessing humanitarian aid, health care, and economic opportunities during the pandemic.\n\nUNHCR continues to ramp up efforts to support government responses to support IDPs, refugees and asylum seekers to cope with critical needs, like access to protection, food, housing and healthcare, including mental health.\n\nIn addition, UNHCR continues to support reception conditions for deportees and returnees and collaborates with partners and governments in the identification of protection needs among those in quarantine.\n\nFUNDING (AS OF 28 MAY 2020) US$ 113.6 M\n\nrequested for the NCA situation1\n\nUNHCR and the Izabal Health Directorate in Guatemala launched a communicating with community\u2019s project where a loudspeaker on a car travels through border communities and Puerto Barrios sharing information on UNHCR and COVID-19 prevention measures. \u00a9UNHCR\n\nFACT SHEET > NCA Situation / May 2020\n\nUNHCR Response and Strategy\n\nUNHCR works with over 70 partners in the region and supports states to implement their national plans under the Regional Comprehensive Protection and Solutions Framework (MIRPS). The MIRPS is a pioneering application of the Global Compact on Refugees. In May, the OAS Permanent Council approved the establishment of a voluntary fund for the MIRPS, which will allow\n\nfor the mobilization of resources to help implement action plans in each country.\n\nMain Activities\n\nAlongside governments, partner organizations, civil society, faith-based organizations, development actors and UN Agencies, UNHCR undertakes protection and solutions activities, including:\n\nSafe reception and admission\n\nUNHCR in Belize supports the Refugees Department in undertaking their duties, including through the donation of an infrastructure to resume registration while ensuring COVID-19 prevention measures. UNHCR in Honduras and El Salvador is supporting the government response to COVID-19 through the conditioning and endowment of reception centres for deportees.\n\nAdvocacy and Coordination\n\nIn Belize, thanks to UNHCR\u2019s advocacy, all family members no longer must be present for the renewal of asylum certificates. In Guatemala, UNHCR is coordinating with the Ministry of Labour to support refugees and asylum seekers who have not been able to renew or apply for work permits during the pandemic. Under the Protection Cluster, UNHCR El Salvador coordinates the delivery of cell phones and tablets to support child protection interviews. UNHCR is coordinating the delivery of food and hygiene kits through government institutions and community leaders in Honduras and El Salvador. In Costa Rica, UNHCR is working with the Migration Authority to ensure that COVID-19 measures do not affect the due process for NCA asylum seekers. Also, UNHCR works with translators to provide Miskita versions of health prevention information and access to RSD processes.",

As a result of severe airstrikes and ground fighting in Hudaydah city and surrounding areas, displaced families have been feeling Al Hudaydah to Sana\u2019a, Hajja, Dhamar and others south to Al Khawkha and Hays where they have received assistance by UNHCR. The international community have warned about the grave consequences on the people of Hudaydah and Yemen as a whole, should a full-scale offensive materialise.\n\nWhile displacement of families is ongoing, UNHCR and its partners are working together to reach a verifiable figure of displacement. The protection of civilians is being increasingly threatened in Al Hudaydah by indiscriminate attacks by the warring factions. According to the latest UNHCR-led Protection Cluster Civilian Impact Monitoring Report, almost 50 per cent of civilian casualties in Al Hudaydah to date have occurred when people were in their own homes or farms, and 25 per cent when they were on the road, many of them trying to access services or find routes to safety. The six-month report also highlighted that a total of 844 incidents caused over 1,800 civilian casualties, 26 per cent of which were women and children. Furthermore, 85 per cent of the incidents resulted in psychosocial trauma implications for the people affected. UNHCR continues to remind all parties to the conflict to ensure the protection of civilians and guarantee their access to humanitarian assistance.\n\nAs UNHCR\u2019s partner carries out distributions of core relief items in Hudaydah city, two displaced Yemeni children find some enjoyment after being forced to flee their homes. Photo: NMO\n\nIDP Response\n\nSince the recent escalation of conflict around Hudaydah, approximately 10,000 displaced families (some 80,000 people) have received some form of emergency assistance from humanitarian partners. To respond to the displacement from Hudaydah and surrounding areas, four Humanitarian Service Points (HSPs) in rural areas and three Transit Sites in Hudaydah city are operational. Registration of displaced families is taking place at the transit sites where rapid response mechanism (RRM) kits and core relief items (CRIs) are being distributed. Newly displaced families are being accommodated in schools in Hudaydah city unless they choose to stay with families and members of the host community.\n\nUNHCR is working closely with humanitarian partners to deliver life-saving assistance to displaced families at transit sites, schools and areas of displacement in Hudaydah city and in other governorates.\n\nUNHCR, through partners, has verified some 6,613 families who have had to flee their homes. Furthermore, UNHCR partners Jeel Al Bena and JAAHD have provided CRIs and emergency shelter assistance to over 3,500 displaced families in Hudaydah city. Families are also being assessed for cash assistance.\n\nThrough its partners, UNHCR is also providing protection/referral services, verification, protection assessments, legal consultations and psychosocial support to displaced families at the transit sites, areas of distribution, schools and community centres in Al Hudaydah city and surrounding areas including Bait Al Faqiah, Al Marawi'ah and\n\nUNHCR\u2019s Sa\u2019ada Field Office has also provided psychosocial support and legal assistance to displaced families in community centres also frequented by an increasing number of vulnerable host community members seeking humanitarian assistance, in particularly cash to cover their most urgent needs, including medical expenses.\n\nApproximately 400 displaced families have arrived in Aden since the beginning of the",

    "text": "31820\n\nUPDATE No 6 SITUATION/CONTEXT INFORMATION .\n\nOn 3 April, the Peruvian Army announced that war tanks were placed at the northern border with Ecuador to prevent irregular entries. Air force planes are currently patrolling more than 20 known informal entry On 3 April, and to support those who depend on their daily income, the government announced the inclusion of independent or self-employed workers in the 380 soles bonus policy. On 3 April, the President declared the obligatory use of face masks in public spaces. On 3 April, after reported abuses by the police, the national Ombudsperson Office informed that the entity will oversee that the rights of transgender people and other members of the LGTBIQ+ community are respected during the enforcement of the new mobility measures. On 4 April, the government announced that vulnerable families can pay water, electricity, natural gas and telecommunication bills in installments. On 6 April the Government declared a 48-hour national curfew during Easter holiday on 9 and 10 April. The Ministry of Health (MINSA) informed that some 12,000 daily tests are needed within the next couple of weeks when cases are expected to increase as the peak is reached.\n\nKEY IMPACTS, NEEDS AND RISKS .\n\nMunicipalities distributing food to vulnerable families are requesting the national identity document \u201cDNI\u201d\n\nto deliver the assistance, excluding refugees and migrants. Food insecurity remains a major challenge for Venezuelan nationals to comply with the quarantine and curfew measures in place, increasing their risk of being detained when looking for food or work, and of being infected.\n\nPartners reported an urgent need of WASH support. Scarcity of certain products affects the distribution of hygiene kits.\n\nRESPONSE .\n\nGTRM / RCO / INDECI The GTRM, together with the UN Resident Coordination Office and the National Institute of Civil Defense (INDECI for its acronym in Spanish), have been coordinating the distribution of 5,000 food kits from private donations between 6 and 11 April. Some 20,000 vulnerable persons in Lima and Callao are being supported through this distribution. The food kits provide sustenance for seven days. \u2022 Protection: GTRM partners scaled up their response to support survivors of gender-based violence. The new referral paths will enable immediate assistance to survivors as well as follow up by partners with the national police\n\nand the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations (MIMP). GBV survivors will not be deported nor penalized in case of an irregular entry. \u2022 GTRM/Ministry of Health: GTRM partners in coordination with the MINSA agreed to provide 12 Refugee Housing Units (RHU) to enhance the capacity of two hospitals receiving persons with COVID-19 Symptoms. \u2022 GTRM/Regional Governments: Partners provided technical assistance on temporary shelter to the regional governments of Tacna and Tumbes, in order to assess suitable facilities to host vulnerable population amid the emergency. OPERATIONAL MEASURES 1. Almost USD 300,000 have been distributed on CBI to support more than 7000 refugees and migrants across Peru. Distributions focused mainly in Lima and in Arequipa, Callao, Cusco, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Madre de Dios, Piura, Tacna and Tumbes. 2. Starting on 7 April, GTRM partners distributed some 580 food kits door to door in Lima. Four soup-kitchens received 380 kits to support up to 1,500 people. 3. The school year started virtually on 6 April and partners are providing educational materials for children in temporary shelters in Tumbes.\n\nKEY FIGURES\n\nREFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ASSISTED.",

Furthermore, armed conflict in Wadi Al Jareef (Sirt region) on 10 June reportedly heavily affected local communities,\n\nleading to new displacement to Sirt city (at least 1,900 IDPs). Overall, DTM identified an additional\n\n1,095 internally displaced families (approximately 5,475 individuals) since the last update, bringing the total number of internally displaced persons to at least 4,790 families (approximately 23,950 individuals) who have been forced to leave their homes since 04 June.\n\nDISPLACEMENT LOCATIONS\n\nNew arrivals of IDPs were reported in urban areas in Eastern Libya, particularly in Benghazi and\n\nEjdabia, but also other locations such as Al Bayda, Shahat, Tobruk, Abyar and Qaminis. Some of the new IDPs had reportedly previously stayed in Sirt and Shwayrif, but moved further East. Please refer to the map on page two for more details on the current displacement locations.\n\nHUMANITARIAN SITUATION\n\nThe majority of newly displaced families are staying with relatives, friends and host families. Collective shelters have also been set up by local authorities, currently hosting 3,180 IDPs in Ejdabia, Tobruk, Shahat, Bayda, Bani Waleed and Benghazi.\n\nOn 09 June, DTM conducted a rapid displacement survey with 168 newly displaced households in Benghazi, Ejdabia and Shahat. The most commonly reported humanitarian priority needs in displacement locations were Non-Food Items (82%), Food (79%), WASH (23%) and Health\n\nassistance (22%). The vast majority of respondents (85%) indicated they had not received any humanitarian assistance. Most surveyed IDP families in the three locations were staying in private accommodation (90%) while 10% reported temporarily staying in collective shelters.\n\nAT LEAST\n\n(4,790 FAMILIES)\n\nreported not having received any assistance\n\nreported having family members suffering from chronic diseases\n\nProject funded by the European Union\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nDISPLACEMENT DESTINATIONS\n\nIDPs displaced to Ashswayrif IDPs displaced to Sebha IDPs displaced to Brak Shati IDPs displaced to Derna IDPs displaced to Brega IDPs displaced to Jufra IDPs displaced to Al Khums IDPs displaced to Mezda IDPs displaced to Solug IDPs displaced to Tripoli area\n\n150 Mezda\n\nAT LEAST\n\nDISPLACED SINCE 04 JUNE 2020\n\nIDPs displaced to Zawya (from South Tripoli) 425 IDPs displaced to Marj 475 IDPs displaced to Qaminis 625 IDPs displaced to Tobruk 675 IDPs displaced to Abyar 775 IDPs displaced to Shahat 925 IDPs displaced to Bayda 1,900 IDPs displaced to Sirt IDPs displaced to Bani Waleed 5,250 IDPs displaced to Benghazi IDPs displaced to Ejdabia\n\n925 IDPs to Bayda 775 IDPs to Shahat 625 IDPs to Tobruk\n\nProject funded by the European Union\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 END] *********\n",

    "text": "6308\n\n12 - 19 October 2018\n\nUNHCR FLASH UPDATE\n\nOn 16 October, UNHCR evacuated 135 vulnerable refugees and asylum-seekers (127 men, four women and four children) from Tripoli to UNHCR\u2019s Emergency Transit Mechanism (ETM) in Niger. The group included Eritrean, Ethiopian, Somali and Sudanese nationals. This is the first evacuation to take place since June 2018. As a result of the heavy clashes in August, UNHCR had temporarily halted its humanitarian evacuation programme for the safety and security of its staff and persons of concern. On the same day, 85 refugees from Syria, Sudan and Eritrea departed on two flights from Tripoli to Timisoara, Romania, with the assistance of IOM, the UN Migration Agency. They will be hosted temporarily at UNHCR\u2019s Emergency Transit Centre before flying onwards to Norway for resettlement. As of 17 October, UNHCR evacuated 2,082 individuals out of Libya (1,675 to Niger, 312 to Italy and 95 to Romania). UNHCR also submitted 930 individuals for resettlement directly from Libya to seven States (Canada, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and\n\nPopulation Movements\n\nAs of 19 October, the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG) rescued/intercepted 14,156 refugees and migrants (9,801 men, 2,126 women and 1,373 children) at sea during 108 operations. So far in 2018, the LCG recovered 99 bodies from the sea. The majority of individuals disembarked in Libya comprised Sudanese (1,847 individuals), Nigerians (1,832 individuals) and Eritreans (1,542 individuals). UNHCR and its partner International Medical Corps (IMC) continue to provide core-relief items (CRIs) and vital medical assistance both at the disembarkation points and in the detention centres to where individuals were subsequently transferred by the authorities. So far in 2018, UNHCR and its partner IMC provided 10,315 CRI kits and 1,543 medical consultations at the disembarkation points in Libya.\n\nUNHCR Response\n\nSo far in 2018, UNHCR implemented 86 quick-impact projects (QIPs) across Libya. In Tripoli, UNHCR and its partner Danish Refugee Council undertook a sanitation and hygiene (WASH) intervention to clean up grey water and solid waste. The project will contribute to the public health of a neighbourhood that is currently hosting internally displaced persons (IDPs). QIPs promote peaceful coexistence and strengthen the resilience of IDPs and their host communities.\n\nOn 14 October, UNHCR and its partner LibAid started a distribution campaign of school bags that will target 3,085 internally displaced children in eastern and southern Libya. Due to the liquidity crisis in Libya, the price of school materials has increased over the past years. With this campaign, UNHCR hopes to mitigate the financial impact that the start of the school year has on refugee families.\n\nUNHCR continues its activities in detention centres. So far in 2018, UNHCR conducted 1,005 protection visits to detention centres where it distributed CRIs to 16,859 individuals. UNHCR\u2019s partner IMC provided 21,577 primary healthcare consultations and 231 medical referrals to governmental hospitals. UNHCR continues to advocate for the release of all of its persons of concern from detention and for alternatives to detention. The situation in Zintan detention centre remains dire, with a partially broken sewage system and very limited access to potable water. The centre holds 1,350 refugees and migrants. In response, UNHCR and its partners continue to provide humanitarian assistance there, including daily medical assistance and winter clothes, as part of UNHCR\u2019s winterization campaign.\n\nSpecial thanks to major donors: Canada | Denmark | European Union | Finland | France | Germany | Italy | Japan | Norway | Sweden| Switzerland |The Netherlands | United Kingdom | USA | Private\n\nKey Figures people of concern 55,913 registered refugees & asylum-seekers 193,581* internally displaced persons 382,222* IDP returnees\n\nUNHCR Coordinated Sectors\n\nShelter & NFI Sector Cash & Markets Working Group (Co-led by UNHCR & IOM)",

    "text": "29466\n\n********* [PAGE 1 START] *********\n\nProtection Monitoring During COVID-19 Crisis - Libya Access to Information, Services and Livelihoods - 30 April - 5 May 2020\n\nThe impact of the infectious disease COVID-19 has heightened protection concerns and other needs across Libya, especially for at-risk population groups.1 The country is in its ninth year of instability and conflict, which has severely undermined governance structures and deteriorated basic service provision. Recent weeks have seen an increased intensity of fighting in Tripoli alongside shortages of water and electricity. This, combined with restrictions introduced to help limit the spread of the virus, have resulted in increased humanitarian need in the Libyan capital.2 REACH, in collaboration with the Protection Sector and the Mixed Migration Centre (MMC), set up this assessment to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and related policies on access to information, services and livelihoods for at-risk populations in Tripoli. This factsheet presents the findings from the second round of data collection, with the first round collected 4-9 April 2020.\n\nFor the second round, data was collected by trained REACH enumerators via phone calls with Key Informants (KIs) between 30 April - 5 May 2020. Enumerators used the online digital data collection platform Kobo Collect to insert interview data. The tool used in the survey was designed by the Protection Sector, with the support of REACH.\n\nIn total, REACH enumerators interviewed 25 KIs, among whom were 16 community representatives, and 9 service providers. The former were representing Libyan non-displaced (4) and Libyan communities with internally displaced persons (IDPs) (3), as well as migrant and refugee communities from West African (3), East African (3) and Middle East and North African (MENA) countries (3). Service provider KIs were sought for the following types of provider: UN agencies and International Non-Governmental Organisations (INGOs) (2), local Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) (3), and health workers (3). REACH adopted a data saturation model for analysis, whereby only consensus views are represented in this factsheet, unless stated otherwise.\n\nKIs were identified through a snowballing approach, using contacts from protection actors and local field teams as starting points. KIs were requested to state explicitly those communities they felt they were able to speak on behalf of at the beginning of the questionnaire. The assessment is designed to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on vulnerable populations in Libya through regular and rapid data collection. Findings represent KIs\u2019 perception of the situation faced by the communities they represent or serve, and therefore, are indicative only. For consistency between data collection rounds, REACH field teams kept KI contacts consistent where possible; in a minority of cases respondents were unavailable, which might explain some inconsistency in findings between rounds. This has been stated in the text where applicable.\n\nINCORPORATION OF MIXED MIGRATION CENTRE (MMC) FINDINGS\n\nIn an effort to streamline the evidence base for the humanitarian response in Libya, REACH has been working\n\nclosely with MMC to harmonize assessments and identify areas of complementarity in findings. During the assessment inception phase, REACH and MMC collaborated to establish shared research questions and objectives. As with the first round of data collection, during data analysis for the second round, REACH worked closely with MMC in order to triangulate findings and share analytical approaches.\n\nThroughout this factsheet, results from MMC\u2019s survey and KI data are referred to in order to triangulate with REACH KI data. MMC conducted telephone surveys with 442 migrants and refugees in sites across Libya, including Tripoli, Benghazi, Ajdabia, Ghadames, Misrata, Oubari, Sebha and Sirte. The sample was comprised of 25 nationalities, including Nigerian, Sudanese, Nigerien, Ghanaian, Malian, Cameroonian, Chadian, Burkinabe, South Sudanese, Eritrean and Ethiopian.3",

    "text": "5651\n\nWFP Country Name July 2018\n\nContact info: Flavia Brunetti (flavia.brunetti@wfp.org) Country Director: Samer AbdelJaber Further information: www.wfp.org/countries/Libya\n\nIn Numbers\n\n175,000 people in need targeted for food assistance in 2018 86,728 people assisted so far this year US$7.4 m six months (August 2018 \u2013 January 2019) net funding requirements\n\n86,728 people assisted in JULY 2018\n\nOperational Updates\n\nWFP Country Director (CD) Mr. Samer AbdelJaber had a meeting with the Mayor of Benghazi to discuss how best to support the country, as well as meeting with the Port of Benghazi Maritime Authority to discuss issues relating to the port, which is a critical entry point for food and other humanitarian commodities entering the country.\n\nIn July, WFP reached an average of 86,728 people in need throughout the West and South of Libya. Some of these were new populations and locations: as a response to the feedback of many beneficiaries to WFP staff present at distributions, a new distribution point was opened in Alkhoms, providing a closer point of food collection for those of the Tawargha community living far from Tripoli. Another new distribution point was set up for vulnerable families displaced in Alkararim (240 km from Tripoli), in response to the dire need of food reported by the Misrata Social Affairs Department. July marked the first time food assistance was provided throughout the entire West contemporaneously, with WFP distributing much- needed food assistance in both Sirte and Ghadames, two points on each side of the Western part of the country, at the same time.\n\nAlso in July, the new budget revision was approved to extend the emergency operation until the end of December 2018, at which point an Interim Country Strategic Plan (ICSP) will launch for 2019-2020. The next months of the operation incorporates new activities, such as a cash-based transfer pilot and livelihood activities, which will bridge into the ICSP.\n\nWFP\u2019s new programmatic directions will focus on livelihoods, helping to stabilise the process in the country, including through the gradual recovery and strengthening of national safety net systems. The operation is exploring the possibility of expanding its assistance to other vulnerable population groups through a larger range of more innovative modalities such as electronic voucher systems that will give more freedom of choice to people served and positively impact the local economy.\n\nWFP Operations\n\n*August 2018 \u2013 January 2019\n\n\u2022 WFP will continue its provision of food assistance to the food insecure and vulnerable populations in Libya, and will also continue to respond to sudden onset emergencies as part of the Libya Country Team rapid response mechanism. \u2022 WFP Libya will explore the potential positive contribution of a school meals programme, and through its renewed presence on the ground, will make efforts to improve data availability of food insecurity and populations most susceptible to becoming insecure, should the conflict worsen. \u2022 Currently, WFP monitors its activities through a Libyan Third- Party Monitor, Moomken, while a Tunisian call center makes 150 monthly calls to the people in Libya who have most recently received food. WFP trained their contracted call center (based in Tunis) on Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM), and through them is conducting PDM calls covering distribution locations throughout the West and South of the country. This is part of WFP\u2019s ongoing efforts to scale up monitoring and evaluation of its activities in order to ensure that feedback turns into real change for the operation. \u2022 The last week of June saw a bread crisis in Tripoli, with bakeries closing for the first three days of the week and prices subsequently increasing (from 1 Libyan Dinar buying 4 loaves of bread to only buying 3). A shortage of cooking oil also reportedly began just after the holy month of Ramadan. WFP\u2019s regular assistance in Tripoli includes vegetable oil and wheat flour, helping to relieve the dearth of these two staple items. More information is currently being collected. \u2022 Food insecurity remains a challenge due to protracted displacement, disruption to markets, and lower food commodity production. Livelihoods and access to basic social services have been affected by the conflict, exposing the most vulnerable people to a high risk of inadequate food consumption and forcing people into negative coping strategies such as spending savings, cutting the number of daily meals and reducing non-food related expenses, particularly in health and education.

DTM identified an additional 3,010 displaced families (approximately 15,050\n\n119,925 IDPs (23,985 FAMILIES)\n\nindividuals) since the previous report, bringing the total number of internally displaced persons to at least 23,985 families (approximately 119,925 individuals) who have been forced to leave their homes due to armed conflict since the start of hostilities on 04 April 2019. The majority of IDPs were identified in different neighborhoods of Tripoli, the Nafusa mountain range and along the coastline to the west of Tripoli. Furthermore, 4,754 migrants are currently held in detention centers run by authorities in Libya, out of which over 2,967 migrants detained in Tripoli and nearby areas are considered at high risk of being affected by the conflict.\n\nOn 02 July, a set of airstrikes hit Tajoura detention center (DC) where migrants were being held. The airstrike resulted in at least 53 fatalities while another 87 migrants, including children, were injured*. The sustained use of air strikes and artillery shelling in the vicinity of areas inhabited by civilians, including migrants, continues to negatively impact the livelihoods of civilian population as the conflict has become protracted.\n\nDTM conducted a rapid profiling exercise of displaced families, covering over 6,000 IDPs. A slight majority of sampled IDPs were female (51%), while almost half of the surveyed population were children under the age of 18 (48%). Please refer to the full sex-age breakdown on the left, and to pages 2-3 of this report for more details on location disaggregated figures. * UNSMIL, Remarks of SRSG Ghassan Salam\u00e9 to the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Libya 29 July 2019\n\nDisplacement timeline as per the cumulative number of IDPs tracked by DTM since the beginning of ongoing Tripoli clashes.\n\nProject funded by the European Union\n\nProject funded by the European Union\n\nDISPLACEMENT LOCATION BREAKDOWN:\n\nPRIMARY AREAS OF ORIGIN Ain Zara\n\nQasr Ben Gashir Khallat Al Furjan Wadi Al Rabee\n\nTrig Al Matar\n\nSuq Al Khamees\n\nAT LEAST\n\nINDIVIDUALS DISPLACED SINCE 04 APRIL 2019\n\nIDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to\n\nAREAS OF DISPLACEMENT Abu Qurayn 1,000 IDPs displaced to Kabaw 1,225 IDPs displaced to Nalut 1,375 IDPs displaced to Rigdaleen 1,575 IDPs displaced to Daraj 1,575 IDPs displaced to Kikkla IDPs displaced to Mezda IDPs displaced to Ziltun IDPs displaced to Al Qalaa IDPs displaced to Thaher Al Jabal IDPs displaced to Wazin IDPs displaced to Tawerga IDPs displaced to Alasabaa IDPs displaced to Kremya IDPs displaced to Zwara 3,850 IDPs displaced to Arrayayna 3,925 IDPs displaced to Arrajban 4,075 IDPs displaced to Surman 4,800 IDPs displaced to Aljmail 4,925 IDPs displaced to Baten Aljabal 5,800 IDPs displaced to Jadu 8,550 IDPs displaced to Suq Alkhamees 12,050 IDPs displaced to Siddi Essayeh IDPs displaced to\n\nAl Zahra Qasr Alkhyar Al Ajaylat Al Aziziyah Yefren, Mashashaya and Al Awiniyah Al Khums Al Maya and Al Ameriya Bani Waleed Ain Zara\n\nSuq Aljumaa, Hai Alandalus, Abusliem, and Tripoli Center\n\nProject funded by the European Union",

The high food prices continues to erode the purchasing\n\npower of the population.\n\nServices provision\n\n\u2022 WFP-managed UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) is essential to facilitate humanitarian access, thereby\n\nenabling UN agencies, non-governmental organizations and the humanitarian community to safely and securely reach the most vulnerable\n\npopulations to provide assistance. Effective 17 November, UNHAS activated daily flights to Kassala,\n\nto support movement of response teams. A dedicated helicopter has been stationed in Kassala to improve\n\naccess to remote camp locations in support of the response to the influx of refugees from Ethiopia.\n\n\u2022 In November 2020, UNHAS transported 3,781\n\npassengers from 80 partner organizations reaching over 30 destinations and delivered 4.9 metric tons of light humanitarian cargo.\n\n\u2022 The Sudan Logistics Cluster developed an updated General Logistics Map, showing locations of the refugee camps, condition of roads to the camps, and warehouse capacities within the camps.

    "text": "31898\n\n\n\nCountry examples continued:\n\nCosta Rica: leads one of the working groups of the National Commission on Emergency, which is directed to persons in situations of vulnerability, including older persons, persons with disabilities, persons unsheltered, persons with addictions, and persons with palliative care. El Salvador: in coordination with the Ministry of Health, started the purchasing process for the need to supply 15,000 kits for pregnant women, in a joint purchase with other UN agencies. Likewise, UNFPA is supporting the needs of the Salvadoran Institute for Children and Adolescents (ISNA) with the provision of 940 hygiene kits.\n\nIn some countries, UNFPA has made visible the risks of GBV caused by confinement and SRH implications, particularly with regard to maternal mortality, caused by a disruption in essential services.\n\nCountry examples:\n\nColombia: co-leads the sub-clusters of GBV and SRH for the response to COVID-19. Honduras: as part of the HCT, activated the Gender-Based Violence Area of Responsibility, coordinated by UNFPA, to address the increase in complaints of sexual violence and GBV at large. Uruguay: developed precautionary measures related to GBV (such as extending the deadlines for the placement of ankle bracelets, police custody, distancing measures, etc.) Bolivia: coordinates with PAHO/WHO, UNICEF, the Maternity and Safe Birth Table, the Maternal Mortality Observatory and SRH non-governmental organizations to guarantee the continuity of SRH services. Panama: works with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to map actors working in GBV to update the directory of both governmental and non-governmental organizations that provide care to women and adolescent survivors of violence.\n\nContinuity of SRH Services and interventions, including protection of health workforce\n\nUNFPA across the region continues its coordination efforts with regional partners including PAHO/WHO, UNICEF, Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank, UNAIDS and Professional Associations (such as La Federaci\u00f3n Latinoamericana de Sociedades de Obstetricia y Ginecolog\u00eda) and the International Confederation of Midwives. The objective is to support joint advocacy with health authorities, particularly those related to SRH continuity of care, and preparation of a series of SRH webinars for the Ministry of Health managers and providers of SRH and COVID-19\n\nA declaration is also currently being drafted on the relevance of reproductive rights and the role of midwives in the context of COVID-19, to be signed by the Network of Professional Midwives in Latin America.\n\nIn the Caribbean, UNFPA is partnering with seven International Planned Parenthood Federation affiliates and providing support in reorganizing their service delivery model, including through telemedicine/counselling services (in 13 countries) and community-based contraceptive mobile services (Belize).\n\nCountry examples:\n\nHonduras: UNFPA, PAHO/WHO, SESAL and the Honduran Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics started virtual training sessions on the guidelines for the care of pregnant, in labor, postpartum and lactating women in the context of COVID-19, addressed to more than 500 healthcare professionals. Venezuela: several trainings were organized for doctors and other staff on SRH and STIs/HIV prevention within the COVID-19 context, as well as the use of injectable contraceptives to assist returnees in the 18 shelters organized in border communities. Paraguay: Supporting the development of the logistics management system for PPE commodities and participated in the procurement of PPE. Panama: Providing PPE to SRH service providers serving indigenous communities. Mexico: Advocating for ensuring PPE for traditional and professional midwives, as well as other health personnel working at the first level of neonatal and maternal health care.\n\nAddressing GBV\n\nUNFPA is mobilizing efforts to secure the best response and technical assistance to Women, Health and Social Development authorities to strengthen social protection systems, particularly by guaranteeing the continuity of essential services to prevent and respond to GBV.",

    "text": "50461\n\nThe number of people affected by the Deyr season (October- December) flash floods has increased to nearly 73,000, including more than 13,000 displaced and four suspected deaths, according to field reports.\n\nAt least five states, including Banadir, Jubaland, Hirshabelle, Galmudug and South West have been affected and have continued to report extensive damage to infrastructure and farmland.\n\nIn South West State, overflowing water from River Shabelle has reportedly inundated six villages in Afgooye area, affecting 8,000 people, of whom 3,500 are displaced.\n\nAid workers and local authorities are appealing for urgent humanitarian assistance, including clean drinking water, emergency shelter, food and logistics support to drain the stagnant water that risks disease outbreaks.\n\nSituation overview\n\nAreas affected by Deyr flash floods. Map: OCHA\n\nDeyr seasonal rains, often experienced between October and December in Somalia, have caused widespread flooding resulting in displacement, suspected deaths and destruction of key infrastructure including roads, houses and farmlands, according to humanitarian partners. At least 73,000 people have been affected by the widespread rains and floods, mainly in Banadir, Jubaland, Hirshabelle, Galmudug and South West region.\n\nAmong those affected are more than 53,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) and members of the host community in Baidoa town, in South West State, whose living conditions were already dire. An estimated 4,000 people have been temporarily displaced from their homes in the town, of whom one third have been evacuated to higher grounds in northern Baidao. At least 80 per cent of the IDPs living in temporary shelters are likely to be affected if the rains intensify. A rapid assessment conducted by Camp Coordination Camp Management cluster partners indicates that at least 157 IDP sites with a population of over 97,360 IDPs are lacking shelter and non-food items, including sites where displaced people have settled in the past six months.\n\nFlooding has affected farmlands in several areas and may impact food security in the period ahead. In South West State, a sustained increase in river levels in River Shabelle, particularly along Afgooye, Hirshabelle and Jowhar areas, has resulted in overflow and river breakages, inundating 5,000 hectares of farmland in six villages. In Jubaland State, overflow from River Dawa has inundated 5,000 hectares of farmland and affected about 10,000 people in Dollow and Belet Xaawo\n\nDestruction and damage of key infrastructure, including roads and residential areas, has been reported in multiple locations. Heavy rains on 6 November caused flash flooding and landslides in Goofgaduud Buurey, 30km north of Baidoa, Bay region. Two houses were destroyed and more than 50 people temporarily displaced to higher ground in the village.\n\nIn Hirshabelle State, roads linking Jowhar to Mogadishu and the road to the airport were reportedly flooded. This has impacted transport for passengers and essential supplies, including foodstuff from Mogadishu to Jowhar town. Although river levels along the lower reaches in Jowhar are slightly high, the levels of the Shabelle River in the upper reaches of Belet Weyne and Jalalaqsi remain within the normal levels.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nSomalia Deyr Season Flash Update #2 | 2\n\nIn Banadir, partners report that at least 730 houses occupied by IDPs and 250 latrines have been damaged by the flash floods. Stagnant water is seen in most low-lying areas creating a high risk for water-and vector-borne diseases such as malaria and acute watery diarrhoea outbreaks.\n\nIn Jubaland State, roads in Kismayo were reportedly impassable following flash floods on 2 November; made worse by poor drainage in the city. At least eight water pumps were reportedly submerged and semi-permanent settlements in Kismayo destroyed. More than 6,000 people in Dollow and nearly 3,800 people in Belet Hawo districts, Gedo region, have been affected. In the last two weeks, flash floods in Lower Juba region have affected 2,000 IDPs in Danwadaag settlement in Dhobley and exposed them to the risk of water-borne diseases. The airstrip at Dhobley was flooded and flights suspended for a week, but it has since re-opened.",

    "text": "51575\n\nThe next Strategic Situation Report will be released on 30 December\n\nSituation Overview: UPDATED Global Update: According to John Hopkins University, the number of people worldwide who have died with COVID-19 is more than 1.5 million, with many regions still reporting surging numbers of new infections as part of a second and confirmed cases, as of 10 December. World leaders came together in a special virtual session of the General Assembly economic recovery that can put the world back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n48,753 people across all 34 provinces in Afghanistan are 36.7 million have been tested. Afghanistan now has a test- positivity-rate \u2013 positive tests as a percentage of total tests \u2013 of 30 majority of recorded deaths were men between the ages of 50 and seropositivity study by MoPH, Johns Hopkins and WHO that estimated 30 per cent of the population and risk communications work is critical to turning this around. WHO warns that widespread complacency and failure to follow public health advice is creating grave risks in the community with people generally not observing physical distancing or mask wearing protocols.\n\nSecond Wave: The MoPH has confirmed that Afghanistan is in a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following two months of consistently lower confirmed COVID-19 cases, MoPH tracking data is starting to reflect anecdotal reports of a recent uptick in cases, with 1,495 new COVID-19 cases recorded over the past week. Furthermore, suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 are again rising in the western part of the country in particular. According to WHO, the Hirat Regional Hospital is currently operating at full capacity, prompting local authorities to ask NGO health partners to expand bed capacity for COVID-19 patients. The hospital has now expanded its bed capacity from 100 to 130 beds, all of which are now filled with COVID-19 patients. Other COVID-19 hospitals in Kandahar and Nangarhar are also operating at full capacity. While the official numbers across the country are not yet at the same level as the May/June peak, when taken together with reports of increased hospitalisations for COVID-19-like symptoms, the need for vigilance should be reinforced. The rollout of the annual influenza vaccination across Afghanistan will be more important than ever to help the health system manage the rise in COVID-19 cases. Increasing influenza vaccine coverage can reduce the strain on the health care system and free-up limited health resources to focus on treating more severe cases of COVID-19. Public health experts strongly urge the public to follow health advice on physical distancing, mask wearing, good hygiene, hand washing and other proven strategies that mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission amid this second wave.\n\n16 Days of Activism: Throughout the global campaign for 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence from 25 authorities, community and religious leaders, and individual Afghans \u2013 to increase efforts to prevent and redress violence against women and girls. This is particularly important in the context of COVID-19 where monitoring by UNAMA suggests that violence against women and girls has increased, just as it has become more difficult for victims to report crimes and access safety and justice. According to a new report released on 7 December by UNAMA and the UN Human Rights Office, Afghan women and girls are being failed by the country\u2019s justice system with their access to justice for crimes of\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is to mobilize and coordinate effective and principled humanitarian action in partnership with national and international actors.\n\nUpdate: COVID-19 | 2\n\nPeople with disabilities: According to Handicap International, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the isolation and exclusion of people with disabilities across the world. Essential health services \u2013 that are already insufficient in poor countries \u2013 have become even harder for people with disabilities to access due to COVID-19 restrictions or medical resources being prioritised to treat those with the virus. Without access to the care they need, people with disabilities can see their health status worsen, risking complications and additional permanent difficulties or reduced functional ability. HI also reports that it is also critical for people with disabilities to be included in COVID-19 awareness raising campaigns. Information leaflets are usually not adapted for people who are blind or visually impaired and many awareness resources are only distributed in hospitals, which are not always accessible to people with disabilities. Finally, people with disabilities are also being disproportionately affected by the economic shock associated with COVID-19.",

In response, AHP partners such as World Vision have increased their outreach activities through volunteers and facilitators to reach vulnerable women in their homes as well as at the Safe Space.\n\nThese visits are a lifeline for many women, particularly those with disabilities, who may be socially isolated.\n\nFor Somira, life with a physical disability, coupled with social stigma, had impacted her confidence and freedoms. After a fall from a coconut tree in childhood, Somira\u2019s right hand became non-functional. Her family viewed her as a financial burden due to her disability, treated her with neglect, and limited her opportunities to go outside the home. On the rare occasions she would go out, she often faced harassment and teasing. All this led to Somira feeling depressed and helpless.\n\nWhen Somira learned from a volunteer about the opportunity to participate in activities at the Safe Space and to learn new skills, she expressed her interest in getting involved, but was also fearful about leaving her home to attend the centre.\n\nThe volunteer arranged for a World Vision staff member to visit Somira and provide psychosocial support. Somira said she had goals to become more active, to be able to do something for herself and to help her family, and to live like other 22-year-olds.\n\nAs Somira still did not feel ready to attend activities in person, World Vision staff visited her at home three days each week to teach her handicraft and sewing skills, setting her homework for the other days of the week. Somira now has the skills to produce handmade fans, pillowcases, tablecloths, and traditional embroidered quilts (nakshi-kantha).\n\n\"Learning how to make these handicrafts benefited me,\u201d Somira said.\n\n\u201cI can earn money by selling them. I used to think that I have to remain dependent on others for the rest of my life. Now I can earn on my own.\u201d\n\nSomira says she hopes to earn enough to buy a sewing machine, to save some money and help her family.\n\n\u201cNow no one despises me, even though I don't have a hand, because like others I can do something for myself and my family. Though not with a big amount, now I can support my family financially.\u201d\n\nSomira\u2019s story is not unique in the camps, said Shahida Amin, Gender-Based Violence Coordinator with World Vision.\n\n\u201cBut one story alone cannot describe how people, especially women and women with disability, are living here. In a small place, lots of dreams are confined inside houses when society and social norms stifle the independence of a woman,\u201d Shahida said.\n\n\u201cWe, as service providers, prevent gender-based violence [GBV] through different capacity- building activities that create independent women in the most vulnerable Rohingya communities, with the aim of creating a GBV-free society.\u201d\n\nHowever achieving shifts in gender norms and disability inclusion takes time, Shahida added.\n\n\u201cWe are observing remarkable changes in society. But we need to continue our work. It\u2019s not possible to change society in a year. We need to mobilise more to reach all the communities.\u201d\n\nThe Australian Humanitarian Partnership (AHP) Bangladesh response is implemented by a consortium of all six AHP NGOs and their local partners. The current phase continues until June",

In Gor\u00e9, the Level 1 biometric registration exercise of new arrivals is ongoing in close collaboration with Chadian authorities. As of 18 January, UNHCR reported 4,384 new arrivals (1,324 households), mostly women and children, in the southern Chadian province of Logone oriental, projected to reach 5,000 by the end of this week. 755 people were transferred to COVID-19\n\nquarantine centers in Gor\u00e9 and Dosseye; while an additional quarantine center with a 500 people capacity is set to be built in Gor\u00e9. People in quarantine received blankets, mosquito nets, kitchen sets, soap and jerry cans from UNHCR. 755 people have already been provided with food assistance for a month by WFP during the first phase of food distribution which took place upon their arrival. A second phase of food distribution for an additional 2,800 people is scheduled for this week. At the Doholo site, 200 shelters were built. CSSI (UNHCR\u2019s health partner) ensures a regular presence in the host villages and in the quarantine centers to provide medical consultations, screening, vaccination for children and pregnant women as well as nutritional screening. Humanitarian partners are experiencing trouble screening the people who crossed the CAR-Chad border. A number of them are Central Africans but others are Chadian returnees (former refugees in CAR) and even gold miners.

    "text": "68873\n\nIn the months of June and July, several RMRP countries reopened borders that had been closed due to COVID-19 containment measures and/or eased entry restrictions for Venezuelans. Key developments in this respect included:\n\nIn Brazil, starting on 23 June, for the first time since March of last year, Venezuelans could enter the country legally and those who previously entered irregularly could apply to regularize their status.\n\nColombia re-opened its border with Venezuela on 2 June (although this did not lead to any significant subsequent increase in entries or exits).\n\nChile re-opened its borders for the first time in four months on 26 July, but only to Chilean nationals and fully vaccinated foreigners. Newly arriving Venezuelans must still obtain consular permits to enter the country legally.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago re-opened its borders in July, and Curacao began to allow tourists to enter in June, although the border with Venezuela remained closed and Venezuelans required visas prior to entry.\n\nMeanwhile, also during the reporting period, several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean experienced a second or third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with increasing active case rates and deaths in countries such as Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Paraguay. Other countries saw active case rates decline in July, including Bolivia, Uruguay, Guyana, the Dominican Republic, and Trinidad and Tobago. A number of countries made important advances in vaccine campaigns, including outreach to and inclusion of refugees and migrants from Venezuela, while other countries struggled to obtain sufficient doses of vaccine. Highlights in the COVID-19 context from the 17 RMRP countries include:\n\nIn South America, in June Argentina was among the countries with the highest number of daily cases of COVID- 19 and related deaths globally. It implemented a cap of 600 citizens and resident foreign nationals who could enter daily, and suspended the entry of foreigners for family reunification purposes, including Venezuelans. More than half of the population was at least partially vaccinated by the end of July. Bolivia crested a third wave of the pandemic in early June, at times with more than 3,000 new cases a day, which lessened by the end of July, with approx. 14% of the population completely vaccinated. Brazil was the country with the second highest absolute number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the world by 29 June, at 514,092, which rose to 554,497 by 30 July. Only approx. 19% of the population was fully vaccinated by end-July. Meanwhile, on 19 and 20 June, Operation Welcome began the COVID-19 vaccination of indigenous people from Venezuela sheltered in Boa Vista. COVID-19 active cases in Chile soared to over 7,000 new cases / day in mid-June, but then dropped by end-July to under 1,000 new cases / day. Chile reached approx. 65% of the population fully vaccinated by the end of July. In Colombia, the national government issued Decree 744 of 2021, modifying its national vaccination plan to require a census of all persons who do not have an identity document issued by the Colombian Government. Meanwhile, the country carried out large-scale vaccinations of pregnant women, in which refugees and migrants from Venezuela were able to participate regardless of their migratory status. By the end of July, approx. 24% of the population was fully\n\nvaccinated, and 8,798 vaccines had been applied to Venezuelans in Colombia. The Government of Ecuador began \u201cphase 3\u201d of its vaccination program in July, which includes all foreigners, including refugees and migrants from Venezuela no matter their migratory status. As of 31 July, the Ministry of Public Health reported via a public dashboard that 6,792 refugees and migrants had received their first vaccine doses. Hospitals in Paraguay were saturated with COVID-19 patients in June, and by end-July, just 5% of the population had been fully vaccinated when, owing to a lack of vaccines, the country was required to suspend its vaccination campaign. In Peru, the Ministry of Health coordinated with local authorities to remove barriers accessing COVID-19 vaccinations for refugees and migrants, including those relating to difficulties in proving residence and low return rates for second doses (up to 73% were not returning for a second shot, a challenge also identified among host communities),",

Worst affected is White Nile\n\nstate with nearly 66,500 people who are impacted by flooding. Flood water destroyed or damaged at least 34,500 homes and impacted WASH and health facilities. Additionally, thousands of livestock have been killed which is likely to affect livelihoods and food security, especially of poor households.\n\nParticularly vulnerable are the South Sudanese refugees and Sudanese IDP\u2019s whose living conditions were already dire before the onset of the crisis. Most urgent needs reported are shelter, WASH, health and food assistance (OCHA 20/08/2019).\n\nBriefing note \u2013 22 August 2019 Sudanese states affected by floods as of 20 August 2019\n\nSource: OCHA (20/08/2019)\n\nAny questions? Please contact our analysis team leader, Benedetta Cordaro: bc@acaps.org\n\nCrisis impact\n\nHeavy rains, that started on 13 August, caused flash floods in 15 out of 18 states across Sudan. States affected include El Gezira, Gedaref, Kassala, Khartoum, North Darfur, North Kordofan, Red Sea, River Nile, Sennar, White Nile, South Darfur, East Darfur, West Darfur, South Kordofan and the Abyei area. As of 20 August, flooding has affected an estimated 179,000 people as reported by the government\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC). At least 54 people have died as a result of the flooding. According to initial assessments, conducted by the HAC, over 22,800 houses are destroyed and at least another 11,700 are damaged (OCHA 20/08/2019). The floods also damaged an unknown number of public facilities including mosques, schools, health centres and government institutions (Radio\n\nDabanga 18/08/2019). With nearly 66,500 people affected, the White Nile state is the worst impacted. About 13,300 houses have been either damaged or destroyed by the flooding, in addition to some 335 latrines (OCHA 20/08/2019). As assessments are still ongoing, these\n\nnumbers represent merely an estimate of the impact on the assessed regions. Furthermore, it is unclear what the HAC means by the term \u201caffected\u201d. Numbers of people displaced by the floods have not been reported.\n\nSudan\u2019s rainy season typically lasts from June to September. Torrential rainfall is forecast in the coming days until at least 24 August in the River Nile, Northern, Red Sea, Gedaef, Gezera, White Nile, North Darfur, South Kordofan, North Kordofan and Khartoum\n\nstates. Ongoing rains raise the risk of additional flooding in these states (HAC 19/08/2019).\n\nACAPS Briefing Note: Floods Sudan\n\nImpact of the flooding in Sudan as of 20 August Source: OCHA 20/08/2019 * Figure reported by HAC in the OCHA situation report (20/08/2019). It is unclear what is meant by 1,67 houses damaged in the West Darfur state. The number is therefore not included in the calculation of the total number of houses damaged by floods in Sudan. ** The total number includes the houses destroyed in the Abyei PCA. The Abyei area is a contested area between Sudan and South Sudan. Abyei is claimed by both countries and has been a source of conflict in Sudan for over 50 years. ***Total sum of the breakdown per state as reported by HAC differs from the total number of people affected reported by HAC in the OCHA situation report (20/08/2019). Total number in the report leaves out the people affected in West Darfur and East Darfur states as well as the Abyei area.\n\nMost people affected are in need of shelter, WASH, food and health assistance.\n\nShelter & NFI\u2019s: With over 34,586 houses damaged or destroyed, emergency shelter is a major need among the affected population. Families are reported to be sleeping under trees. It is unclear how many people have been displaced by the flooding. NFI needs include plastic sheeting, blankets, mats and household supplies (OCHA 20/08/2019).\n\nWASH: Most of the affected people are in need of WASH assistance. Over 5,600 latrines have been destroyed across the affected region. Drainage of stagnant water has started in some areas, especially in Khartoum state, but has not yet commenced in most of the affected areas (OCHA 20/08/2019). Stagnant floodwater may become contaminated with sewage due to the deconstruction of latrines leading to infectious diseases (HAC",

    "text": "47466\n\nQuick alerts Country: CHAD\n\n11 December 2020\n\nHEALTH SITUATION\n\nCOVID-19 update As of 9 December, 1,739 cases and 102 deaths have been reported in 17 provinces. Between 6 and 11 December,\n\n14 new cases have been reported in N\u2019Djamena alone. This is the first time that all new cases are reported in the capital and none in the provinces for several consecutive days. The new cases of this week concern contact cases and travelers (prospective and returning). Since 21 November, a cluster of cases seems to have developed within the refugee camp of Dossey. As of 2 December, 20 refugee cases from Dossey camp have been committed to the isolation district center of Gore.\n\nLocal authorities initially wanted to shut down the camp but several youth groups in the camp protested against this measure and vehemently confronted the unit in charge of the security of the camp. Mediation between local and international partners successfully prevented this measure from being implemented. Significant action is being taken by UNHCR to enhance prevention measures in the camp: support to regional and department hospitals as well as to health centers taking in refugees from Central African Republic. In the biweekly meeting on 4 December chaired by the Minister of Health and National Solidarity, concern was expressed particularly about large assemblies - weddings, funerals, in places of worship - as the festive season starts, and which could act as vectors for COVID-19 spread. An emphasis was placed on reinforcing the COVID- 19 preventative measures already in place and significantly scaling up sensitization to the communities.\n\nInternational partners have been asked to ramp up support for health response teams in the south, where health and administrative authorities from the four regions have put in place a coordination crisis committee, chaired by the Governor at province-level, and by the prefect at department-level.\n\n(WHO situational reports and UNHCR)\n\nHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE\n\nCadre Harmonis\u00e9 predictions better than anticipated during summer HRP revision. According to the results of the latest Cadre Harmonis\u00e9 (CH), 5,615 people have been identified in \"emergency phase\" (phase 4 out of 5) for the October-December 2020 period; the figure is projected to increase by tenfold up to 54,458 during the next lean season of June-August 2021. These people require humanitarian assistance, including free food aid and animal food supplements as well as activities strengthening nutrition, health, livelihoods and resilience. For the current period of October-December 2020, no department has been declared in \u201ccrisis phase\u201d (phase 3\n\nout of 5), even though 595,159 people have been identified to be in this phase. As for phase 2, \u201cunder pressure\u201d,\n\n28 departments and 2,113,378 people are concerned. The situation is expected to worsen during the projected June-August 2021 period, with 14 departments and 1,148,995 people expected to be in \u201ccrisis\u201d or \u201cemergency\u201d phase (phases 3 and 4). These people would be in a malnutrition rate superior to the emergency threshold. Ten more departments (bringing the total to 38) are projected to be \u201cunder pressure\u201d between June and August 2021, affecting 2,854,081 people. These predictions are better than what was expected in June during the HRP revision when the impact of COVID- 19 was projected to be more extensive. The CH analysis has revealed that markets are well supplied with cereals and other agricultural products from the 2020/2021 harvests. This availability is reinforced by the stocks of traders and imports from Cameroon and Sudan.

    "text": "11319\n\nDerna Rapid Situation Overview Libya, 28 March 2019\n\nFINDINGS BY SECTOR\n\n\u262a Displacement\n\n\u2022 Within a month after the end of active conflict in Derna\u2019s Old City, many households displaced by the fighting had returned to formerly encircled areas of Al-Bilad and Al-Maghar. Most of these returnees had previously been displaced to other parts of Al-Bilad or to Derna\u2019s outer mahallas, particularly Embakh, Sheiha, As-Sahil, and 400.\n\n\u2022 Returnees to the Old City area confronted heavy damage to shelters, community buildings, and municipal infrastructure, especially streets and power grids.\n\n\u2022 Returnees also reportedly continued to resettle in other areas of central Derna, in particular El-Jebilah, Esh-Shabiya, and Dheil el-Wadi, arriving mostly from Benghazi and Albayda. As of mid-March, returnees also continued to trickle back into the heavily damaged mahalla of Hay as-Sayyida Khadija, primarily from Albayda and Shahhat. Though all of these mahallas had been accessible since mid-2018, return was a slow process for many households due to heavy damage to shelters and lingering contamination by explosive remnants of war (ERW).\n\n\u2022 In addition to the ongoing returns, KIs in Al-Bilad and El-Jebilah reported IDPs leaving these mahallas for other areas of east Libya, particularly Albayda, Shahhat, Alqubba, and Tobruk.\n\n\u2022 According to KIs, as of March, most of the IDPs who remain displaced throughout Derna city were unable to return because their shelters had been damaged or destroyed. Though some KIs also cited the risk of further conflict or specific threats against households, both concerns were less commonly reported than they were in July-August 2018 during the ISCG Multi-Sector Needs Assessment (MSNA).2\n\n\u262a Freedom of Movement\n\n\u2022 At the time of data collection, KIs reported few restrictions on freedom of movement throughout Derna, apart from checkpoints. Most permanent checkpoints were located in the vicinity of the Old City, still marking the former perimeter of encirclement. In addition, ad hoc checkpoints were often set up by armed groups to perform more stringent searches and identification checks.\n\n\u2022 While checkpoints did not prevent most residents from moving around the city, their presence, and the armed group activity that surrounded them, was correlated with reports of safety and security incidents in the mahallas where they were located (see Protection). KIs in most mahallas with checkpoints reported that those who transited them were occasionally at risk of verbal harassment and detention.\n\n\u2022 Freedom of movement was additionally constrained by the presence of ERW, especially in\n\nand around the Old City.\n\n\u2022 Movement into the Old City had become difficult for drivers, as many streets were destroyed or littered with rubble during the active fighting; there was reportedly little access for larger commercial vehicles.\n\n\u2607 Shelter\n\n\u2022 Extensive damage was reported to Derna\u2019s Old City and surrounding areas, particularly parts of Al-Bilad and Al-Maghar mahallas, little of which has yet been repaired. This damage affected not only shelters, but also key community infrastructure, including, but not limited to, three mosques, a clinic, and a central market.\n\n\u2022 The city\u2019s power grid was also reportedly damaged, partly due to the conflict and partly due to theft of power cables that had not been replaced. KIs across all mahallas reported experiencing 3 to 6 hours of power cuts per day, a situation unchanged from July-August 2018.3 Telecommunications infrastructure was in turn affected, with phone and internet connectivity in the city remaining limited.\n\n\u2022 Most IDPs who remained displaced within Derna used their own resources to find and\n\nretain shelter. Across most assessed mahallas, KIs estimated that roughly equal numbers of IDPs were renting their own accommodations and being hosted by friends or family (excepting the 400 mahalla, where an estimated 75% were being hosted, and As-Sahil, where 75% were renting). In El-Jebilah, an estimated 60% of the IDP population was reported to be living in shelters they owned, whether permanent or makeshift; the same was reported to a lesser extent in Esh-Shabiya, El-Fataih, and Hay As-Sayyida Khadija (20-35%).",

    "text": "3486\n\nProtracted clashes in Al Hudaydah Governorate YEMEN: Al Hudaydah Districts\n\nIMPLICATIONS ON THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION\n\nPreliminary information indicates that up to 14,000 households may have been displaced in the last three days from Al Khawkha, Hays and Zabid districts. Unconfirmed reports indicate that the road between Al Garrahi and Hays is blocked, and might be contami- nated with mines. This is limiting the movement of civilians. The Wadi Naklah bridge on the main road connecting Hays and Al Garrahi has reportedly been damaged. Hays hospital, the main health facility in the district, is not operational since 10 December 2017, after it was damaged by airstrikes. The facility should be re-operationalised as a matter of priority. The Water Desalination Plant in Al-Khawkhah Junction in Hays is operating at half capacity after the main gen- erator was damaged. The pumps need to be urgently repaired or replaced. WHO has managed to deliver 20 tons of life-saving medicines and medical supplies to respond to rising number of injuries received by hospitals in Hudaydah. Farming and fishing activities have been disrupted, thereby cutting off a major source of livelihood in the coastal areas such as Tuhayat district where the majority of the population (approx.102,000 people) work in the fisheries and agriculture sectors. Livestock watering and feeding have been disrupted. This may negatively affect households\u2019 purchasing pow- er and their nutrition situation. Livestock vaccination and treatment are needed. Displacement towards southern governorates continues: Aden hub reports having received almost 7,000 displaced households since December 2017. Approximately half of the IDPs originate from the districts of Al Garrahi, Hays, Al Khawkhah, Al Mokha, Zabid and Al Hudaydah.\n\nTRENDS IN COMMERCIAL IMPORTS VIA UNVIM\n\nCommercial imports have recovered to pre-crisis averages following the lifting of the blocked imposed on food imports bound to Red Sea ports on 26 November and on fuel imports on 20 December. In January 2018, UNVIM facilitated the discharging of 21 vessels to Hudaydah and Saleef ports, 10 vessels carrying food and 11 carrying fuel. While the pre-blockade monthly average (July 2016 to October 2017) was 35 vessels discharging, the num- ber of vessels discharging in January increased 24 per cent and 75 per cent when compared to November and December 2017, respectively.\n\nIn January 2018, food imports were 13 per cent lower (290,830) than pre-blockade monthly average of 335,185 metric tons and decreased 3.5 per cent compared to December 2017. In January 2018, fuel imports were six per cent higher (165,082) than pre-blockade monthly average of 156,235 metric tons and increased more than 12 fold, (1,158 per cent) compared to December 2017. Other cargo remained at zero for the second month, as all containerized cargo was diverted to Aden. The pre-blockade monthly average for other cargo was 150,449 metric tons.\n\nUPDATE FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS\n\nThe Aden hub is coordinating the humanitarian re- sponse to displacement in Abyan. WFP is conducting food distributions for all the new arrivals, while ACF and UNICEF are dispatching WASH kits. Protection teams have been coordinated to conduct assessments in coastal districts, while NFIs were distributed by IOM and its partners. Cluster are reviewing potential re- sponses in the coastal districts of Mokha and Dhubab, in Taizz Governorate with efforts focusing on food secu- rity, health, nutrition and protection.\n\nWhereas Ibb governorate has been relatively calm, hu- manitarian operations in Taizz have been significantly affected by armed clashes In the last week, however, the intensity of the clashes has decreased compared to the start of the recent offensive on 25 January. In mid-January, conflict in Taizz reportedly displaced at least 635 families.\n\nPlans are underway to implement a famine risk assess- ment and food security classification in Sa\u2019ada using 15 survey teams each composed of four staff, including two appointed by the local authorities and two females. Civilian casualties from shelling and airstrikes continue to be reported in Sa\u2019ada governorate. However, the number of incidents with a civilian impact decreased between 25 January and 1 February from 24 the pre- vious week to 12. This is the first time in a given week within the past two months that airstrikes were not the main cause of civilian impact incidents. 91 per cent of all incidents occured in districts on the Saudi-Yemen",

    "text": "6549\n\nLOGISTICS CLUSTER - YEMEN Situation Update September 2018\n\nDue to ongoing fighting around Hodeidah and a resulting increase in humanitarian activities targeting Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), the Logistics Cluster has been tasked with coordinating Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) deliveries to Humanitarian Service Points (HSPs) and Transit Points (TPs) which were established as locations to provide IDPs with relief items. \u2022 The Logistics Cluster is in charge of cargo consolidation at the common warehouse (WFP IRR, UNICEF hygiene kits and UNFPA transit kits into RRM kits) and the coordination of deliveries of the consolidated cargo to RRM implementing partners. \u2022 Within the framework of the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), there were significant delays in the dispatch of Phase 9 kits due to deconfliction requests not being granted. All kits in stock have now been moved from the warehouse in Al Marawiah to the warehouse in Bajil and all dispatches will be carried out from there. This should ease dispatches as Bajil warehouse is further away from the frontline. For Phase 9, all IRRs have been delivered, while the remaining kits (transit and hygiene kits) will be dispatched in the coming days. Once Phase 9 is completed, dispatches for Phase 10 and 11 will be undertaken: for these two phases, UNFPA transit kits are already in Bajil while hygiene kits from UNICEF will arrive in Bajil in the coming From 1 October, OCHA handed over monitoring and supervision of the RRM to UNFPA; the first meeting chaired by UNFPA will be held on Thursday 4 October at the UNFPA office in Sana\u2019a. The Logistics Cluster is only in charge of assembling the RRM kits at the three common warehouses in Hodeidah (Bajil), Sana\u2019a and Aden and of dispatching them to implementing partners in field locations; last mile delivery to beneficiaries is to be carried out by implementing partners. VOS Apollo is now in the holding area outside Hodeidah in case of a potential downsizing of international staff to allow VOS Theia to replenish food and fuel supplies in Djibouti.\n\nIn September, the Logistics Cluster facilitated the transport of 109 mt/537 m3 of relief items on behalf of IOM, UNICEF and WHO. Of these, 65 mt/358 m3 were transported to throughout for rotations from 10 to 13 September; the remaining 48 mt/179 m3 were transported through three rotations on 24, 26 and 27 September. A tentative airlifts schedule for the rest of 2018 is available on the cluster website at the following link: \u2022 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are available at: www.logcluster.org/document/standard-operating- In September, UNHAS transported 1,233 humanitarians to and from Yemen. UNHAS schedule for October is published on the Logistics Cluster website at:\n\nLOGISTICS CLUSTER - YEMEN Situation Update September 2018\n\nDue to continued issues with authorities in Djibouti, the two VOS vessels have suspended their services since the second week of September. Meanwhile, two dhows are being organised to ship cargo to Aden on behalf of OXFAM and WFP, and to Hodeidah on behalf of FAO and WHO. Estimated time of departure and arrival will be shared with service users shortly.\n\nIn light of the above, no cargo was shipped by sea in September.\n\nVOS Apollo is in a holding area outside of Hodeidah, while VOS Theia is in Djibouti for bunkering. For any urgent sea cargo transportation needs, the Logistics Cluster is able to organise dhows to Aden and Hodeidah on behalf of requesting organisations.\n\nFive refrigerated containers arrived in Djibouti in early September and are to be installed on the two VOS vessels. Two will be located on board the VOS Theia, two will be located at Aden port, and one will replace the rental container on board the VOS Apollo. If installation on board the two vessels isn\u2019t possible, they will instead be used to provide temperature-controlled and cold chain storage in Aden and Hodeidah.\n\nA survey to assess organisations\u2019 needs and interest in continuing to use Djibouti as a logistics hub was shared with the mailing list and completed by 34 participants. Due to continuing issues with the operations of the VOS Apollo and VOS Theia, the Logistics Cluster and WFP are still exploring the possibility of shifting operations to other locations. A few options are being considered and will be confirmed at a later stage. The Logistics Cluster still envisages carrying out sea cargo transport to Aden and Hodeidah, and air cargo transport to Sana\u2019a, from these locations if required.",

    "text": "42352\n\nJoint Humanitarian INGO Statement: Sustaining Support for the Rohingya Refugee Response 22 October 2020\n\nOver three years since violence in Myanmar forced more than 700,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh, refugees continue to wait for safe, dignified, and voluntary return to their homeland. In Myanmar, approximately 600,000 Rohingya remain, including 130,000 confined to camps in central Rakhine state, where they are denied freedom of movement, their right to citizenship, and access to essential humanitarian services. Across the region, humanitarian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) face myriad challenges in meeting the Rohingya\u2019s life-saving needs. At times and in some locations, such challenges are unnecessarily imposed.\n\nThrough this joint statement, the NGO community highlights priority areas for collective action and recommendations for the international community and national actors in refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) hosting contexts in the region. We collectively have an obligation to support the Rohingya now so they can start to safely\u2014and dignifiedly\u2014rebuild their lives in a manner that ensures full enjoyment of fundamental human rights.\n\nPRIORITY ISSUES AND BACKGROUND\n\nOngoing Human Rights Crisis in Myanmar\n\nIn Myanmar, the escalation of conflict between the Myanmar Armed Forces and the Arakan Army since December 2018 has forcibly displaced over 90,000 Rakhine (also known as \u2018Arakanese\u2019) and other ethnic groups, killed and maimed civilians, and damaged critical infrastructure. The continued reliance on \u2018clearance operations\u2019 criticized in the U.N. Fact-Finding Mission report has resulted in indiscriminate targeting of civilians, including those least able to flee the impacts of conflict such as children, older people, pregnant women, and people with disabilities. In recent weeks, conflict has intensified in Rathedaung and Myebon townships, causing more gender-based violence incidents, injuries, and deaths\u2014including of women and children. With movement restrictions in place, Rohingya and other conflict-affected communities are caught in the crossfire and cannot access healthcare and other life- saving humanitarian assistance. The use of explosive weapons by conflict parties\u2014accompanied by evidence of recent landmine use and the threat of unexploded ordinances\u2014further hinders IDPs\u2019 return\n\nFor more than eight years, 130,000 internally displaced Rohingya and Kaman communities in central Rakhine have been confined to camps. They now face the risk of permanent encampment and segregation as the construction of permanent camp-like housing moves forward without the consent of, or meaningful consultations with, affected communities. No concrete action has been taken to lift movement restrictions that would enable communities to rebuild their lives.\n\nFollowing a surge in confirmed COVID-19 cases in August, preventative measures have been implemented and enforced inconsistently, with marginalized communities such as the Rohingya facing harsher punishment and extortion with the enforcement of such measures. Coupled with pre-existing movement restrictions, marginalized communities are having greater difficulties accessing healthcare and essential services. There have also been blanket restrictions on humanitarian operations that negatively impact communities\u2019 health and well-being in Rakhine State.\n\nInternet restrictions on 3G and 4G connectivity remain across seven townships in Rakhine State. The current 2G connection restricts basic access to email and websites, preventing communities from accessing vital information on the conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic. It also obstructs humanitarian and government actors from effectively delivering risk messages and critical services remotely, particularly in the COVID-19 context, when their access to affected communities is severely restricted due to measures in place to slow down transmission.\n\nThe Government of Myanmar continues to promote the National Verification Card (NVC) process, including through coercive measures, which does not offer a reliable pathway to the enjoyment of basic rights or full citizenship and, in some cases, erases Rohingya identity by forcing them to identify as \u2018Bengali.\u2019 Political disenfranchisement of Rohingya continues to expand ahead of Myanmar\u2019s national elections in November 2020, with Rohingya candidates barred from running for office and most Rohingya, both inside and outside the country, without access to the required documentation to vote.",

Corroborated reports have also been received that a health worker was killed in airstrikes on the night of 29-30 April. \uf0b7 The international community reminds all parties to the conflict that the principal of proportionality, as preserved in International Humanitarian Law, must be adhered to. All sides must avoid the indiscriminate use of force such as the use of aerial bombardment or shelling in civilian areas.\n\npeople internally displaced by ongoing hostilities\n\ncivilian casualties including 22 civilian fatalities\n\npeople assisted with some form of humanitarian assistance since the onset of crisis\n\nfunding required for Tripoli Flash Appeal\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nCountry Emergency Situation Report No. 19 | 2\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\n\uf0b7 Health personnel and facilities continue to be impacted by the armed conflict, in violation of international humanitarian law. On 28 April, a Grad rocket impacted a cafeteria near to the Ali Omar Akar hospital in Espeaa, along the Tarhouna road, south of Tripoli, causing damages and leading to the temporary evacuation of this frontline hospital \u2013 including hospital staff and a WHO Emergency Medical Team deployed since 24 April to provide specialist support at Ali Omar Akar hospital. In another reported incident, corroborated by Health sector partners, a health worker was killed during airstrikes on the overnight of 29-30 April. This would bring the total of health workers killed since the beginning of the conflict to four, with one other doctor injured and 11 ambulances also directly or indirectly impacted. These incidents further hamper the ability of already overstretched health services to provide vital assistance to civilians, including those inured as a result of armed conflict.\n\n\uf0b7 Reports of indiscriminate airstrikes and rocket/shelling attacks again impacting civilian areas, resulting in at least one reported civilian casualty and damages to civilian homes, on the overnight of 29-30 remain under verification at the time of reporting. Since the beginning of the conflict at least 96 civilian casualties, including 22 fatalities have been verified.1 These casualties include five medical personnel, at least four children, and at least three foreign nationals (refugees/migrants). According to Health Sector partners, one child was killed and three children injured in airstrikes during the past four days.\n\n\uf0b7 According to latest DTM-IOM figures, over 42,600 individuals have fled their homes since the start of the conflict. Some 1,725 new IDPs have been identified in the past 48 hours in Al Ajaylat, Garabolli, Msallata, Sabratha, Suq al Jumaa, Tajoura and Qasr Al Kyar. Most IDPs have been identified in various neighbourhoods and suburbs of Tripoli as well as in the areas along the coastal line of Western Libya and the Nafusa mountains. IDPs displaced to areas in proximity to ongoing clashes remain at risk, along with the host communities currently providing them shelter. DTM- IOM reports an increasing number of IDPs in locations further away from conflict-affected areas, particularly along the coastal line of Western Libya. This trend toward movement further away from Tripoli is expected to increase the radius of areas in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\n\uf0b7 An unconfirmed number of civilians remain trapped in conflict areas, where electricity cuts and water shortages resulting from damaged infrastructure are common and access to essential items such as food, medicine and fuel is severely disrupted. Armed clashes, random shelling, roadblocks and explosives placed on roads hamper the ability of humanitarian actors to evacuate civilians and to deliver needed aid, as well as the ability of civilians to move freely to safer areas or access vital goods and services.",

FAO\u2019s attention and interventions cover all stages of the agriculture commodities\u2019 value chain, this includes activities that improve production, processing, marketing and entrepreneurship. The Organization in Syria release the \u201cMonthly agriculture input and commodity price bulletin\u201d that provides timely insights from 35 districts across Homs, Hama, Aleppo, Tartous, Deir-ez- Zor, Rural Damascus, Al-Hasakeh and Dar\u2019a Governorates, to inform relevant stakeholders and food security sector (FSS) partners, who are supporting agriculture and food security interventions in the country, about the prevailing prices of agriculture inputs and commodities. This bulletin is a useful publication since markets and market information both play an important role in food security, income generation, resilience and rural-market linkages. Regular dissemination of market information will benefit smallholder farmers in their market- oriented production endeavours. \uf0b7\n\nKey Highlights\n\nThe continued increase in the prices of agriculture inputs and food commodities continues to add more pressure on Syrian families after 9 years of the protracted crisis. Out of 12 monitored agriculture inputs, five inputs (wheat & barley seed, fuel, fertilizers, pesticides) showed significant price increases. Also seven out of the 15 monitored food items (tomato, \uf0b7 bread, eggplant, sugar, potato, sunflower oil, olive oil) showed significant increases in November 2020. Tomato\u2019s has recorded a significant average price increase by 74 percent, a normal and expected increase during this period as its production season from open fields comes to an end and supply diminishes compared to demand. The average price of bread also increased by an estimate of 33 percent across the monitored\n\ngovernorates, this will lead to limited access among most Syrian families, considering that bread is an important staple food in Syria.\n\nThe continued devaluation of the Syrian Pound against other foreign currencies within the informal exchange market has resulted in constant market price volatility,\n\nsupply chain constraints and inflation. The purchasing\n\npower of the local currency has been greatly impacted across most governorates.\n\nFuel shortage continues to persist in most governorates; this has added challenges to farmers who rely on fuel for land preparation, transportation and other agriculture value chain activities during the current winter season. The fuel shortage is putting financial pressure on farmers as it effects on the overall production costs. There was a notable 21percent increase in the average price of diesel fuel month on month (m-o-m).\n\nThe prevailing high cost of agriculture inputs in the local market will continue limiting access, especially for vulnerable smallholder farmers, since the Government\u2019s subsidized sources are unable to meet the farmer\u2019s full requirements. The existing constraints, besides Covid-19 impact on supply chains and the impact of economic sanctions on Syria will continue to affect importation and exportation of most agricultural inputs and raw\n\nCOVID-19 has continued to exacerbate further challenges Barley\n\namong Syrian families from the beginning of November 2020.

In Banadir region, four IDPs died and hundreds have lost shelters.\n\nFlooding has worsened the impact of the triple threat\n\nThe floods, along with COVID-19 and desert locusts, have significantly changed the humanitarian context in Somalia. Since April, the triple threat has compounded pre-existing vulnerabilities, escalating humanitarian needs and hurting livelihoods \u2013 especially for low- income earners and poor families. As a result, at least 3.5 million people are projected to fall into Crisis or Emergency food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or higher) from June to September, with 1 million children projected to be malnourished. Some 2.6 million people remain displaced and nearly 1 million children out of class due to the COVID-19-related closure of schools. At the same time, desert locusts are eating up thousands of hectares of cops and pasture in Somaliland, Puntland and Galmudug.\n\nHumanitarian partners have ramped up responses to the triple threat. Authorities and humanitarian partners have expanded flood assistance, but gaps remain in WASH, food, shelter and NFI assistance. In Marka district, authorities and partners are relocating affected families to higher grounds. In Afgooye and Wanla Weyn, the Food Security Cluster has provided one-month food rations to 2,000 households. The WASH Cluster has provided hygiene kits to 2,000 households and trucked water for 700 households. WHO has deployed primary health and rapid response teams to support health services. Further support is needed for Wanla Weyn as the response has mostly targeted Afgooye district.\n\nAs COVID-19 cases exceed 3,200, partners have boosted testing and treatment capacity. Risk communication and community engagement has reached about 10.9 million people. Responses to desert locusts have equally been expanded. FAO and regional authorities have sprayed at least 31,086 hectares in Somaliland, Puntland and Galmudug, saving about 62,100 MT of staple foods. Overall, 279 humanitarian organisations are implementing programmes in all 18 regions of Somalia. In May, 2.3 million people received food assistance, a more than three-fold increase from previous months, while 1.8 million were reached in June.\n\nFederal Government opens Multi-Hazard Warning Center in Mogadishu\n\nThe Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management of the Federal Government of Somalia opened on 5 July the National Multi-Hazard Early Warning Center in Mogadishu, which is expected to help prepare for and respond to disasters. The then Deputy Prime Minister HE Mahdi Gulaid, who spoke at the launch of the center, said it is a milestone for the government and people of Somalia. Equipped with both technology and manpower, the center has four major sections: \u2022 Data collection and multi-hazard research. \u2022 Monitoring and early \u2022 Information sharing. \u2022 Multi-hazard early response unit.

Meanwhile, Contact Tracing Supervisors conducted contact tracing for 2,605 contacts registered in Go. Data. Out of these, 1,918 (73.6%) contacts have completed their follow-ups.\n\nDuring week 21 (24- 30 May 2021), no suspected Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) death was recorded; the total remains at 44 in 2021. All deaths were investigated by RIRT as a part of COVID-19 response and of these, 09 came out as probable COVID-19 deaths.\n\nCoordination, Planning and Monitoring Restrictions continue to be in place for movement as communicated by the RRRC and have undergone various extensions. Selected camps with detected high rates of COVID-19 are under stricter restrictions. Health sector is ensuring essential health services through coordination with all relevant sectors and partners. Discussions are ongoing with partners on an effective evidence-based approach for management of mild cases considering the operational and resources implications of various solutions. Simultaneously, Health Sector in coordination with Civil Surgeon\u2019s Office, Cox\u2019s Bazar, continues to work with SARI ITC partners to increase the number of functional beds at the SARI ITCs to manage moderate/severe cases and minimize excess mortality. \u2022 At present, Health Sector is working on updating the \u2018Health Sector Strategic Plan-2019\u2019 to adapt to the changing circumstances to meet current and future needs to propose a common way forward for health for the coming Health Sector partners are currently revising the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for referrals in a collaborative process under the Health Sector Strategic Advisory Group. This process is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. The Health Sector SAG is also developing an Accountability to Affected Populations framework which is expected to be completed shortly as well.\n\nInfection Prevention and Control (IPC)\n\nIn the last week, WHO conducted IPC supportive supervision in BDRCS Field Hospital as a part of quality assurance and control efforts by IPC Technical Working Group (IPCTWG). The aim of this visit was to ensure patient safety & quality of healthcare through capacity building of health workers.\n\nDistrict Laboratory \u2022 In week 22, WHO conducted an on-spot refresher on sample collection and handling in four COVID-19 sentinel sites in the Rohingya camps as a continuous effort to improve the quality of testing outcomes.\n\nCase Management Across the 12 operational SARI ITCs in the camps, there are currently 545 functional beds as of 06 June 2021. Of these beds, 61% are ocupied with COVID-19 patients; more than 80% are mild cases. In general, partners continue to monitor new infection trend and could potentially scale up additional 348 beds. Additionally, at the 250 Bed District Sadar Hospital, 10 Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 8 High Dependency Unit (HDU), and 20 Severe Care Unit (SCU) functional beds are available. Out of these, 22 (58%) beds are occupied at present. During the reporting week, WHO conducted weekly online \u2018Case Conference Call\u2019 for SARI ITC Partners and Cox\u2019s Bazar Sadar Hospital ICU staffs respectively on 01 & 02 June 2021. During these events, technical guidance from different international experts was shared with 16 SARI ITC physicians and all Sadar Hospital ICU staffs.

    "text": "57773\n\nThis report is compiled by OCHA Nigeria in collaboration with humanitarian partners.\n\nGovernment relocates over 2,000 IDP households from public facilities in Maiduguri. Civilian relocations from Monguno camps to Marte LGA raises safety and access concerns. Over 350 households were affected in a fire incident at the Kuya internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in Monguno LGA on 30 May, with several shelters, food, non-food item (NFI) and WASH facilities destroyed or damaged. Health Sector partners supported the rollout of the second round of COVID-19 vaccinations. Deadly armed clash sparks civilian safety concerns in Rann town, where partners recently prepositioned critical\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nThe Borno State Government (BSG) relocated over 2,000 IDP households from NYSC and MOGOLIS camps in Maiduguri, concluding on 31 May. The relocations were planned and implemented by the BSG to return public facilities to their original purposes, such as schools/classrooms. In line with options provided by government, some of the affected IDPs moved to renovated houses in Auno community, others returned to Damasak town, their original community from where they were displaced years ago, and some opted to settle in Maiduguri with cash support from the BSG to rent homes. Due to recent severe weather, some of these renovated houses in Auno already experienced significant damage to infrastructure less than one week after IDPs had relocated there.\n\nOn 2 June, the BSG commenced relocations of some 500 IDP households from Monguno LGA camps to Marte LGA on the shores of the Lake Chad, where attacks by NSAGs and clashes with government forces have escalated since mid-February. Further clarity on these and future relocations is needed, requiring the coordination and involvement of both the state government and humanitarians, to ensure safe, dignified and informed resettlements for IDPs and that essential services and/or humanitarian access to these new areas is not an issue. Marte LGA has never been accessible to international aid agencies due to heightened insecurity. Similar relocations of civilians to Marte LGA in December were followed by NSAG attacks and clashes that forced over 3,000 IDP returnees to flee to neighbouring Dikwa LGA between February and March. OCHA is following up with government lead agencies on ensuring a coordinated and planned approach that results in informed, safe, dignified and principled resettlement and relocations of civilians and their continued access to critical services and assistance.\n\nWorsening insecurity, marked by a spate of non-state armed group (NSAG) attacks and clashes with government forces continues to impact ongoing aid operations across local government areas (LGAs) of Borno State, especially in the northern axis. Operations in Mobbar (Damasak town) and Dikwa LGAs have been limited to critical life-saving response sustained through third parties/community-based actors since mid-April and humanitarian footprints remain low across some locations including Ngala, Monguno and Damboa LGAs due to heightened risks of violence. This affects quality of programming, especially timely follow-up and resolution of emerging issues in the affected areas.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nBorno State Situation Report No. 1 | 2\n\nThe latest in a string of fire incidences in Monguno LGA on 30 May claimed at least 14 lives and affected over 40,000 people across camps and communities in the LGA. The OCHA-led Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) deployed its rapid response mechanism (RRM) to facilitate immediate scale-up of multi-sectoral assistance to households affected in recent fire incidences across camps and communities in the area. The leading causes of fire incidences in the LGA are the influx of new arrivals to congested camps and spontaneous construction of shelters in clusters.",

    "text": "60605\n\n4.9 million people assisted June 2021 (based on dispatches)\n\nWFP Syria Interim Country Strategic Plan (ICSP)\n\nContact info: Lauren LePage (lauren.lepage@wfp.org) Country Director: Sean O\u2019Brien Further information: www1.wfp.org/countries/syrian-arab-republic\n\nPhoto: A focus group discussion session with GFA beneficiaries in southern rural Aleppo governorate \u00a9WFP/ Zuha Akkash\n\nSituation Update\n\nEconomic situation \u2022 Food prices decreased across Syria for the second consecutive month, according to the latest WFP Syria Market Price Watch Bulletin released in June, linked to a strengthening and stabilization of the value of the Syrian pound on the informal exchange market.\n\nFood prices decreased by five percent from April to\n\nMay 2021, reaching 167,842 Syrian pounds (SYP). This follows a two percent decrease from March to April 2021. However, food prices in Syria in May remained\n\n69 percent higher than six months earlier and had\n\nincreased by 197 percent year-on-year.\n\nFood Security Situation\n\nFollowing a slight improvement in April and May, the food security situation in Syria deteriorated again in June, highlighting a sustained worsening trend in the food security situation across the country, according to the latest WFP data. 43 percent of all households surveyed in June 2021 reported poor or borderline food consumption; a 16 percent increase month-on- month (from May to June), and 26 percent year-on- Page | 1\n\nyear (from June 2020 to June 2021).\n\nDrought and Euphrates Water Crisis\n\n\u2022 According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) first Euphrates Water Crisis & Drought Outlook analysis, Syria currently ranks seventh on a global risk index of 191 countries most at risk of a \u201chumanitarian or natural disaster event that could overwhelm response capacity\u201d, partly due to the ongoing drought which is hindering adequate preparedness measures.\n\nPoor precipitation during the 2020/2021 winter season, as well as the months critical for crop development\n\n(January-April), have negatively impacted several\n\ngovernorates in the north-east, with Al-Hasakeh\n\ngovernorate typically noted as the breadbasket of the country, particularly affected. However, all governorates of the country are currently experiencing significantly\n\nbelow average rainfall, with WFP beneficiaries from\n\nother areas, including agriculturally dependent areas of southern Syria, such as Rural Damascus governorate, reporting dry weather negatively impacting crop yields.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n\nApproximately 69,559 COVID-19 cases and 3,346 deaths\n\nhave been confirmed across all areas of Syria as of 30 June. This includes 25,515 cases and 1,876 deaths in\n\ngovernment-controlled areas, 25,534 cases and 707 deaths in north-western Syria, and 18,510 cases and 763 deaths in north-eastern Syria.\n\nNorth-Western Syria \u2022 The security situation in north-western Syria deteriorated significantly in June, with an uptick in violence, including ground clashes and shelling, reported from multiple areas of southern Idlib\n\nAs a result of the recent uptick in hostilities in north- western Syria, the Camp Management and Camp Coordination (CCCM) Cluster recorded close to 44,000 displacement movements from Ehsem, Ariha and Idlib areas of Idlib governorate towards safer areas over the month of June. This represents a noticeable increase of 76 percent compared May (25,000 displacements).\n\nNorth-eastern Syria \u2022 The security situation in Al-Hasakeh governorate remained volatile in June. Continued fighting between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Turkish forces has led to the full closure of the main water pump station in Allouk town in the north-eastern countryside of Al-Hasakeh in June. Allouk water station supplies water to more than one million people in Al-\n\nHasakeh city and its surroundings.\n\nSouthern Syria \u2022 The situation in Dar\u2019a governorate was tense and volatile in June, with tensions between the Syrian Government and \u2018reconciled\u2019 non-state armed groups reportedly escalating. Since 1 June, road access to Dar\u2019a al-Balad has been restricted by authorities, citing security concerns, leaving only one accessible route to the area. As a result, WFP was unable to complete distribution to some 19,250 beneficiaries under the June cycle out of the planned 38,000 to be reached under the June distribution cycle. NB. distribution was since completed on 16 July.",

    "text": "31207\n\nFACT SHEET\n\nNorth of Central America Situation May 2020\n\nAround 470,000 refugees and asylum-seekers from the North of\n\nCentral America in the world and\n\n318,590 internal displaced people in Honduras and El Salvador have\n\nbeen forced to flee their homes because of brutal violence.\n\nAs at May, countries in the region continue to maintain official borders\n\nclosed to prevent the spread of\n\nCOVID19. Cases of violence and internal forced displacement in\n\ncountries of origin continue unabated.\n\nUNHCR and partners have been identifying and assisting people with\n\nunaccompanied children, SGBV survivors (women and LGBTI people),\n\nmen victims of recruitment witnesses of serious crimes.\n\nASYLUM SEEKERS AND REFUGEES By country of origin\n\nSource: Based on data provided by governments to UNHCR as of Dec-19.\n\nGovernments in the NCA maintain curfews and quarantine to avoid a new wave of COVID-19 infections, which continues to impact UNHCR\u2019s presence in communities and people of concern\u2019s jobs and livelihoods. These restrictions also worsen the situation for people at risk in countries of origin, who will face additional difficulties to flee when persecuted. Internal forced displacements continue despite the pandemic.\n\nLGTBI community leaders in the NCA continue to report violence and persecution by gangs that aim to force them into criminal activities or threaten their lives because of who they are. They also experience limitations in accessing humanitarian aid, health care, and economic opportunities during the pandemic.\n\nUNHCR continues to ramp up efforts to support government responses to support IDPs, refugees and asylum seekers to cope with critical needs, like access to protection, food, housing and healthcare, including mental health.\n\nIn addition, UNHCR continues to support reception conditions for deportees and returnees and collaborates with partners and governments in the identification of protection needs among those in quarantine.\n\nFUNDING (AS OF 28 MAY 2020) US$ 113.6 M\n\nrequested for the NCA situation1\n\nUNHCR and the Izabal Health Directorate in Guatemala launched a communicating with community\u2019s project where a loudspeaker on a car travels through border communities and Puerto Barrios sharing information on UNHCR and COVID-19 prevention measures. \u00a9UNHCR\n\nFACT SHEET > NCA Situation / May 2020\n\nUNHCR Response and Strategy\n\nUNHCR works with over 70 partners in the region and supports states to implement their national plans under the Regional Comprehensive Protection and Solutions Framework (MIRPS). The MIRPS is a pioneering application of the Global Compact on Refugees. In May, the OAS Permanent Council approved the establishment of a voluntary fund for the MIRPS, which will allow\n\nfor the mobilization of resources to help implement action plans in each country.\n\nMain Activities\n\nAlongside governments, partner organizations, civil society, faith-based organizations, development actors and UN Agencies, UNHCR undertakes protection and solutions activities, including:\n\nSafe reception and admission\n\nUNHCR in Belize supports the Refugees Department in undertaking their duties, including through the donation of an infrastructure to resume registration while ensuring COVID-19 prevention measures. UNHCR in Honduras and El Salvador is supporting the government response to COVID-19 through the conditioning and endowment of reception centres for deportees.\n\nAdvocacy and Coordination\n\nIn Belize, thanks to UNHCR\u2019s advocacy, all family members no longer must be present for the renewal of asylum certificates. In Guatemala, UNHCR is coordinating with the Ministry of Labour to support refugees and asylum seekers who have not been able to renew or apply for work permits during the pandemic. Under the Protection Cluster, UNHCR El Salvador coordinates the delivery of cell phones and tablets to support child protection interviews. UNHCR is coordinating the delivery of food and hygiene kits through government institutions and community leaders in Honduras and El Salvador. In Costa Rica, UNHCR is working with the Migration Authority to ensure that COVID-19 measures do not affect the due process for NCA asylum seekers. Also, UNHCR works with translators to provide Miskita versions of health prevention information and access to RSD processes.",

    "text": "21346\n\n\u00a9 UNHCR / Jaime Gimenez\n\nThis flash update provides a snapshot of the current situation of refugees and migrants coming from Venezuela to Colombia, Ecuador and Peru following the introduction of a humanitarian visa for Venezuelans put in place by the Ecuadorian Government. It includes updates on the regional movements observed and the preparedness and response put in place by the aforementioned countries. This flash update is produced by the technical team of the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform for Refugees and Migrants from Venezuela.\n\nOn July 26, the Government of Ecuador publicly stated that it would be enforcing new entry requirements for Venezuelan citizens in its territory1. The announced measure establishes the following procedures:\n\n\u2022 The regularization of all Venezuelans that have entered Ecuador up to 26 July 2019. The regularization process will start in October and will benefit Venezuelans that have entered Ecuador through regular channels, carrying a valid passport and that do not have any criminal\n\n\u2022 The requirement for a visa to enter Ecuador to all Venezuelans, to be enforced as of 26 August at midnight. As of this date, all Venezuelan citizens wishing to enter Ecuador will need an Exceptional Temporary Residence Visa on humanitarian grounds. Consulates in Caracas, Bogot\u00e1 and Lima will be able to issue the document.\n\n1. The measure was published as Executive Decree 826 and also appeared on the Ministerial Agreement 103/2019\n\nCurrent situation of refugees and migrants coming from Venezuela to Colombia, Ecuador and Peru\n\nThe announcement of this new entry requirements was followed by an increased number of Venezuelans arriving at the Ecuadorian borders leading to congestions and long waits at the Colombian side of the Rumichaca and San Miguel border crossings. Figures from the Ecuadorian migration authorities showed that during weeks ahead of the implementation of the measure, arrivals increased to a daily average of 3,000 entries, with a peak of 6,000 arrivals on 24 August.\n\nThe number of arrivals in Peru also increased during the days prior to the implementation of the new measure reaching 800 daily arrivals, up from the 400 daily entries registered since the introduction of the humanitarian visa requirement in Peru on June 15.\n\nColombian and Ecuadorian authorities, together with the national coordination platforms for the response to refugees and migrants from Venezuela, implemented contingency plans to provide the necessary orientation and information to those arriving at the borders, identify cases in need of special assistance and ensure a comprehensive and coordinated response.\n\nAs of August 28, the number of entries to Ecuador from the northern borders has drastically decreased and there are small groups with Venezuelans who remain in the Colombian side of the border trying to plan the next steps of their journey. Individuals not carrying a visa to enter Ecuador are not being allowed to access the territory.\n\nIn this context, Eduardo Stein, Joint UNHCR-IOM Special Representative for Venezuelan refugees and migrants, through a statement published on August 292, exhorted countries in the region \u201cto continue to articulate, coordinate and harmonize their policies and to exchange information and good practices through the Quito Process, which as a non-binding group has brought together Latin American and Caribbean countries affected by the outflow of Venezuelan refugees and migrants.\u201d\n\nCOLOMBIA \u2013 ECUADOR BORDER\n\n\u00a9 UNHCR / Jaime Gimenez 2. https://reliefweb.int/report/venezuela-bolivarian-republic/situation-venezuelan-refugees-and-migrants-needs-greater-global\n\nCurrent situation of refugees and migrants coming from Venezuela to Colombia, Ecuador and Peru\n\nPOPULATION MOVEMENTS\n\nFollowing the measures adopted by Ecuadorian authorities on July 26, the northern border of Colombia (North of Santander, Guajira and Arauca) has seen a gradual increase in the influx of refugees and migrants from Venezuela entering the country in anticipation of the measure\u00b4s enforcement.",

The intercommunal conflict that broke out in El-Geneina, Sudan on 3-4 April 2021, is said to have been of extreme violence due to the use of firearms by both parties. Local sources have reported significant material damage, including the looting of the Kalma IDP site in Sudan, the killing of 140 people and the wounding of more than 200. A multifunctional humanitarian team made up of the National Commission for the Reception and Reintegration of Refugees and Returnees (CNARR), UNHCR, WFP and IRC was deployed to the Chadian-Sudanese border on 8 April for an assessment of the humanitarian situation in the area. The Chadian Red Cross and the Territorial\n\nSurveillance Brigade (BST) reported that as of 9 April, there were approximately 166 households of 1,860 individuals having crossed the Sudanese border to find refuge in Adr\u00e9. However, tensions remain high and clashes are still ongoing in El-Geneina, and it is expected that the number of displaced may increase in the coming days, according to local authorities. Upon their arrival in Adr\u00e9, the newly displaced were sensitized on the respect of national and international legislation on the protection of refugees, the need for their relocation to transit or quarantine centers in the city of Adr\u00e9, and their subsequent relocation to refugee camps in order to better ensure their safety and protection and provide all necessary assistance. The families currently hosted on sites near the Adr\u00e9 border live in precarious and insecure conditions, many of them have settled with their children under trees without access to drinking water and basic services. Humanitarian needs are high in terms of water, health, food, nutrition and education. (Source: UNHCR, OCHA)\n\nMoyen-Chari province More than 4,000 Chadian and Central African nationals flee into Chad. On 11-12 April 2021, in light of the current\n\nsecurity situation in the town of Kaga-Bandoro in the Central African Republic (CAR), 4,122 Chadian nationals and a significant number of Central African nationals preemptively crossed the border into Chad and fled to the town of Sido (Moyen-Chari province). Displacement movements are still ongoing. IOM will continue data collection through its DTM and a team is already following cross-border movements on site. CNARR and UNHCR started registering the newly displaced on 13 April and to date, nearly 1,200 people have been registered. Humanitarian teams have been dispatched to the border in Sido to continue the registration operation. One of the main challenges is that the Belom camp, identified to host the newly arrived, currently only has a thousand places available. A meeting was held on 15 April in Maro between humanitarian partners and administrative and traditional authorities to explore the possibility of settling these people in host villages in line with the \u201coutside camps\u201d approach. Since the beginning of the year and without including the new arrivals, UNHCR and its partners have pre-registered 9,185 people from 2,731 families arriving from CAR due to the violence. Of these, 4,938 people have been relocated to the Dohollo and Gondj\u00e9 camps. It is estimated that there are between 700 and 1,000 individuals still at the border (Komba, Ndouba-Soh, Yamodo) and more than 600 on the B\u00e9kan axis waiting to be pre-registered and relocated.\n\n(Source: CNARR, UNHCR, IOM, OCHA)\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nOCHA operational updates | 2\n\nINTERCOMMUNAL VIOLENCE\n\nSalamat province Resumption of intercommunal violence in the East results in over a hundred people killed and over a hundred injured. Local and security sources have reported that on 14 April intercommunal clashes between herders and farmers resumed in Am-Barid, a village located about 20 km from Am-Timan, capital of the Salamat province. Another intercommunal clash occurred on 15 April in the locality of Siheb. As of 16 April, more than a hundred people have been killed and over a hundred more have been injured during the recent violence outbreak. It is",

    "text": "52935\n\nConflict incident Internal displacement Disruption of services\n\nSouth: 14,000 people receive assistance for winter\n\nFighting between Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and a non-state armed PLAN (HRP) REQUIREMENTS & group (NSAG) continued mainly in Hilmand, Kandahar and Uruzgan provinces. In Kandahar province, armed conflict is ongoing in Shah Wali Kot, Panjwayi, Zheray and Maywand districts. The increasing insecurity along the highway between Spin Boldak and Kandahar city may interrupt humanitarian activities on the border. The Requirements (US$) \u2013 HRP main roads connecting Panjwayi, Arghandab, Zheray and Maywand are either closed or contaminated with Improvised Explosive Devices (IED). In Hilmand province, the security situation remains unstable with sporadic armed 48% funded (US$) in 2020 clashes ongoing. The main roads connecting Lashkargah to Nawa-e-Barakzaiy, Nad-e-Ali and Nahr-e-Saraj districts are closed including the main road connecting Kandahar to Lashkargah. The closure of the roads has significantly impacted humanitarian services within the districts as well as public movements. In Uruzgan province, fighting and airstrikes in Gizab district in Uruzgan province reportedly killed five civilians (four women and a child). In another incident, two civilians were reportedly killed by an IED detonation in Lablan Yakari village in Gizab district, Uruzgan province. Between 22 and 24 November, 1,084 internally displaced persons (IDPs) received humanitarian assistance including cash, food, relief items, tents, water, sanitation and hygiene supplies in Kandahar and Zabul provinces. A total of 10,827 people affected by conflict were identified to receive humanitarian 0.53M assistance in the coming days in Hilmand, Uruzgan and Nimroz provinces. Winterisation assistance is ongoing in the south aiming to reach an estimated 2,000 households (approximately 14,000 people). During the reporting period, a humanitarian partner provided winterisation assistance to 400 households (approximately 2,800 people) in Uruzgan, Nimroz and Zabul provinces. In Kandahar, the number of families\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is to mobilize and coordinate effective and principled humanitarian action in partnership with national and international actors.\n\nWeekly Field Report | 2\n\nhumanitarian partners aim to reach with winterization support increased from 600 to 800; and in Hilmand, the target increased from 500 to 800 families.\n\nWest: 3,759 people received humanitarian aid, including items for winter\n\nThe security situation remained unstable in the west. Following a needs assessment, humanitarian partners assisted 1,331 IDPs with cash, food, relief items, and hygiene supplies in Badghis, Ghor and Hirat provinces. A total of 7,000 displaced families (approximately, 49,000 people) who are residing in informal sites in Hirat province will receive hygiene supplies by mid-December. Additionally, 42 people that were assessed as being in need were assisted with food, relief items, shelter repair and health services following heavy rainfall in Hirat province. Ongoing winterisation assistance reached 2,386 vulnerable displaced people, people in the host community and returnees in Badghis and Ghor provinces. According to humanitarian agencies, at least 45,000 families (approximately 315,000 people) are in need of winterisation assistance in the west. However, current funding will cover less than a third of people in need.\n\nCentre: Almost 7,000 people received humanitarian assistance\n\nThe security situation remained unstable in the central part of the country with incidents reported in Bamyan, Kabul, Logar, Maidan Wardak, Paktya, Khost, Paktika and Ghazni provinces.

    "text": "46502\n\nUNHCR COLOMBIA RESPONSE UPDATE #16\n\n1-15 November 2020\n\nVenezuelan family participating in the UNHCR-financed shelter and humanitarian assistance project with the Colombian Red Cross in Medellin. \u00a9UNHCR/Catalina Betancur.\n\nCurrent Context\n\nThe Colombian Ministry of Health confirmed 1,308,376 cases of COVID-19 as of 29 November, with Bogot\u00e1 concentrating the highest number (374,077 confirmed cases). A total of 36,584 individuals have died from COVID-19 and 1,204,452 cases have recovered.\n\nAccording to Migraci\u00f3n Colombia, 119,885 Venezuelans have returned to Venezuela from or through Colombia since the 14 March border closure (as of 16 November).\n\nUNHCR and partners are monitoring the flux of caminantes (people transiting on foot) entering Colombia via informal crossing points and heading towards cities inside the country or third countries. According to this monitoring, an average of 80-100 Venezuelans enter daily in Arauca and 300 per day in C\u00facuta.\n\nOn the Ecuadorian border, an average of 15 people per day are taking informal crossings to enter or leave Colombia. The capacity to provide assistance for and monitor this population in transit on the southern border is limited due to presence of illegal armed actors and limited access.\n\nUNHCR COLOMBIA RESPONSE UPDATE #16 1-15 NOV. 2020\n\nIn addition, during the reporting period, 1,681 individuals returning to Venezuela were registered at the Transitory Health Attention Centre (CAST in Spanish), of which 1,360 received information and orientation from UNHCR.\n\nThe eviction of 30 family groups occupying an informal settlement near Cali\u2019s bus terminal scheduled\n\nfor 30 October was suspended following the intervention of GIFMM Valle de Cauca with local authorities. The Secretary of Social Welfare in Cali is now designing a response route for the Venezuelan families.\n\nAccording to external sources, between November 1 and 15, seven massacres have been registered in the municipalities of Nech\u00ed, T\u00e1mesis and Betania (Antioquia), Argelia (Cauca, with two events), Tierralta (C\u00f3rdoba) and Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico). Persistent violence due to territorial disputes by illegal armed actors in the Bajo Cauca region, southern C\u00f3rdoba, southwestern Antioquia and in the\n\nmunicipality of Argelia in Valle del Cauca are of great concern, and some have caused recent\n\nEmergencies due to large-group displacements and confinements are also reported in the municipalities of Bajo Baud\u00f3, Litoral de San Juan (Choc\u00f3), L\u00f3pez de Micay (Cauca) and Olaya Herrera (Nari\u00f1o), mainly due to confrontations between illegal armed actors, homicides and threats to social leaders. In Bajo Baud\u00f3 72 families (322 people) were displaced from the communities of Buchad\u00f3, Villanueva and la Loma. The confinement of approximately 600 families (3,000 persons) from 14 communities in the Purricha River was also reported. In Docord\u00f3, capital of the Municipality of Litoral de San Juan, 99 families (276 persons) were displaced; 11 communities of approximately 590 families (2,200 persons) are confined. In L\u00f3pez de Micay, 18 families (40 persons) of the El Play\u00f3n Community Council were displaced, while 120 families (290 persons) are confined. Finally, in Olaya Herrera, 223\n\nfamilies (543 people) were displaced from the villages of Vuelta Larga and Boca de Prieta. Recurring emergencies in the latter municipality are a concern, since several villages have been displaced up to three times during 2020.\n\nUNHCR has worked with the Victim\u2019s Unit (UARIV) to register and attend to displacements and confinements, as well as promoting an institutional response through the Subcommittee on Prevention, Protection and Guarantees of Non-Repetition jointly with the Ministry of the Interior, the Ombudsman's Office and the Inspector General. In addition, UNHCR takes part in meetings aimed at identifying and following up on emergencies resulting from large-group displacements and confinements and to highlight gaps in the registration of events.\n\nAn illegal armed group entered Sabaletas, Limones, Guaimia and San Marcos villages near Buenaventura by boat, killing one person, wounding one and leaving behind a threatening pamphlet.",

An additional 1.8 million people were assessed to be at risk of falling into food insecurity.\n\nThe deterioration seen is primarily the result of protracted conflict and mass population displacement that has eroded livelihoods and resilience,\n\nPage | 1\n\ncompounded by a devastating economic crisis since\n\nIn response to the findings, WFP is preparing to revise its 2019-2021 Syria Interim Country Strategic Plan to increase the number of people targeted for food\n\nassistance in line with the increased needs. However,\n\nWFP will require significant additional funding to be able to scale-up the beneficiaries it is able to reach under its general food assistance programme.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n\nAs of end January, approximately 43,151 COVID-19 cases and 1,610 deaths had been confirmed across all areas of\n\nSyria. This includes 13,762 cases and 895 deaths\n\nreported in government-controlled areas; 20,939 cases and 426 deaths reported in north-western Syria, and 8,450 cases and 289 deaths reported in north-eastern\n\nSyria as of 27 January.\n\nNorth-Western Syria\n\nAt least two people were killed, and several others injured in two separate bomb explosions in Jandaris and Afrin cities of northern Aleppo governorate in early January. In response, the United Nations Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria, Mr. Imran Riza, and Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis, Mr. Muhannad Hadi, issued a statement, strongly condemning the attacks. Floods caused by heavy rainfall have severely impacted IDP sites in north-western Syria, with thousands of WFP beneficiaries affected. WFP and its cooperating partners are participating in the emergency response through the distribution of ready-to-eat rations (RTEs) to people affected by the floods and had assisted some 8,100 people by the end of January, with distributions\n\nNorth-eastern Syria \u2022 Tensions between government forces and the Kurdish- led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the Al-Hasakeh and Qamishli (Al-Hasakeh governorate) delayed the distribution of WFP food assistance for some 200,000 people in January. WFP extended the January cycle for ten days to complete distributions, following the receipt of necessary clearances. \u2022 The security situation in Al-Hol camp continued to deteriorate in January. On 21 January, the United Nations Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Syria, Imran Riza, and Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis, Muhannad Hadi, issued a joint statement on the deteriorating situation. WFP operations in the camp are\n\nSouthern Syria\n\nOn 12 January, the new WFP Country Director and Country Representative, Mr. Sean O\u2019Brien, visited\n\nTishreen bakery in the town of Dar\u2019a Al-Balad (Dara\u2019a\n\ngovernorate), wich was rehabilitated in cooperation with Premi\u00e8re Urgence Internationale under WFP\u2019s \u201cFarm-to- Bread\u201d- value chain/food system concept. The bakery\n\nnow provides fresh bread to some 40,000 people each\n\nDuring the visit, the first batch of bread was tried with success. Furthermore, positive feedback and\n\nappreciation for the project was communicated to WFP\n\nby local community representatives.\n\nWFP Response\n\nWFP dispatched humanitarian assistance sufficient for an estimated 4.8 million people across all activities in Syria in January.\n\nA total of USD 2.9 million in cash-based transfers (CBT) was distributed to 129,000 WFP beneficiaries across four activities: The General Food Assistance (GFA) CBT pilot; School Feeding (support to out-of-school children); Malnutrition Prevention (support to pregnant and lactating women); and Livelihoods, Resilience and Social Safety Nets.\n\nIn response to COVID-19, and under agreement with UNFPA, CBT top-ups at a total value of USD 844,800 were distributed, allowing the households of the 75,400 pregnant and lactating women and girls (PLWG) assisted by WFP to purchase hygiene items (benefitting some 377,200 people).\n\nAs part of the Health Sector-led response to COVID-19 in Syria, WFP, in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) had by the end of December provided food assistance to some 13,950 people in ten quarantine and nine isolation centres in Aleppo, Hama, Homs, Lattakia, Tartous, and Rural Damascus governorates. The project is funded through the Syria Country-Based Pooled Fund (CBPF).\n\nGeneral Food Assistance (GFA) Programme \u2022 In January, WFP dispatched GFA sufficient for some 4.6 million people across all 14 Syrian governorates. \u2022 Cross-border deliveries from Turkey accounted for 28 percent of the total WFP general food assistance dispatched. This includes food rations for some 1.3 million people areas of Idlib and Aleppo governorate inaccessible from inside Syria. Livelihoods, Resilience and Social Safety Nets \u2022 WFP reached some 53,500 people under its livelihoods, resilience and social safety-nets-projects across Rural Damascus, Dar\u2019a, Quneitra, As-Sweida, Homs, Hama, Ar-\n\nPage | 2\n\nRaqqa, Al-Hasakeh, Aleppo, Lattakia, Tartous and Deir Ezzor governorates.\n\nconnects between Damascus and Qamishli (Al- Hasakeh governorate).\n\nSchool Feeding Programme\n\nWFP assisted 314,900 children with in-school provision of fortified snacks.\n\nWFP supported 33,300 out-of-school children with food vouchers in Damascus, Rural Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama, Al-Hasakeh, Lattakia, Tartous, Dar\u2019a, Quneitra and Deir Ezzor.\n\nNutrition Programme\n\nWFP dispatched nutrition products for the prevention of acute malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies for 143,900 children and pregnant and lactating women and girls (PLWG). This includes 75,400 PLWG who received nutrition support through CBT to purchase fresh food from WFP-contracted shops.\n\nWFP dispatched nutrition products sufficient for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition for 5,500 children and PLWG for one month.\n\nClusters and Common Services\n\nLogistics Cluster \u2022 Facilitating the cross-border operation from Turkey, the WFP-led Logistics Cluster transshipped 1,034 Syrian trucks from Turkey in January. A total of 21,640 mt of Health, WASH, food, and Shelter items were transshipped on behalf of WFP, IOM, UNHCR, UNFPA, WHO and FAO.\n\nUnited Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) \u2022 The first flight of the United National Humanitarian Air Service from Damascus to Aleppo took place on 18 January. Since its start, UNHAS has transported over 1,000 passengers on the first UNHAS route which\n\nIn January, UNHAS Syria completed 15 rotations on the Damascus-Qamishli-Damascus-route as well as on the Damascus-Aleppo-Damascus-route, transporting 211 passengers and 4.8 mt of light cargo. Of the passengers transported, 58 percent were UN staff, and 42 percent were staff from national and international non-governmental organisations.\n\nResourcing Update\n\nWFP requires USD 377.7 million to keep operations running at current levels through July 2021.\n\nWFP Representative and Country Director: Sean O\u2019Brien Operational Information Management Officer: Dani Barbara (dani.barbara@wfp.org) Logistics Cluster Coordinator: Christophe MORARD (christophe.morard@wfp.org)\n\nFor further information, visit the WFP Syria website.\n\nPage | 3",

Meanwhile, Contact Tracing Supervisors conducted contact tracing for 2,669 contacts registered in Go. Data. Out of these, 1,952 (73%) contacts have completed their follow-ups.\n\nDuring week 22 (31 May- 06 June 2021), 01 suspected Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) death was recorded; the total increases to 45 in 2021. All deaths were investigated by RIRT as a part of COVID-19 response and of these, 09 came out as probable COVID-19 deaths.\n\nCoordination, Planning and Monitoring Restrictions continue to be in place for movement as communicated by the RRRC and have undergone various extensions. Selected camps with detected high rates of COVID-19 are under stricter restrictions. Health sector is ensuring essential health services through coordination with all relevant sectors and partners. Health Sector partners are currently revising the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Referrals and drafting an Accountability to Affected Population (AAP) framework in a collaborative process. These documents are expected to be finalized shortly. The \u2018Health Sector Strategic Plan-2019\u2019 is being upated to adapt to the changing circumstances to propose a common way forward for health in the coming years. An SOP on Health Care Waste Management in Health Facilities in Cox\u2019s Bazar has been endorsed by the Civil Surgeon, Cox\u2019 Bazar.\n\nInfection Prevention and Control (IPC) In week 23, the KOBO tool for reporting in monthly IPC score cards for SARI ITCs has been finalized.

Monitoring visits with technical support to these piloting sites have already taken place. Meanwhile, the protocol for the COVID-19 Ag-RDT piloting has been developed by WHO under the guidance of Civil Surgeon, Cox\u2019s Bazar. In week 23, assessment of 06 health facilities eligible for setting up COVID-19 sentinel sites has been completed.\n\nCase Management\n\nAcross the 12 operational SARI ITCs in the camps, there are currently 572 functional beds. Of these beds, 52% are ocupied with COVID-19 patients; more than 90% are mild cases. In general, partners continue to monitor the infection rate to potentially scale up additional 325 beds. Additionally, at the 250 Bed District Sadar Hospital, 10 Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 8 High Dependency Unit (HDU), and 20 Severe Care Unit (SCU) beds are functional. Out of these, 18 (47%) beds are occupied at present.",

Between 4 and 7 October,\n\nthere have been 36 new cases in N\u2019Djamena and in the southern provinces of Moyen-Chari, Mayo-Kebbi ouest and Logone occidental. The health state of emergency, scheduled to end on 17 October, is expected to be renewed for a third time as the country has shown no sign of easing in restrictions and case flare-ups continue to occur. According to the local press, universities in N\u2019Djamena are experiencing difficulty in upholding barrier measures among students: only two out of 10 students comply with them. Meanwhile, in the East, the number of chikungunya cases now stands at 35,109 as of 5 October.

Despite the unstable security situation in the Lake Chad region, President Deby sees this new deployment as a way to coordinate efforts in the fight against terrorism in the region. This deployment has been received positively by the Ministers of the G5 Sahel who addressed their \u201cdeep appreciation towards the Marshal of Chad, the Chadian Government and Chadian people for this show of solidarity\". This deployment will be the first for the Chadian army since the Bohoma attack last March, after which all deployments abroad had been suspended. On 24 September, the eastern operation of the G5 Sahel captured 23 weapons in Wour, Tibesti province, in the North of Chad. Ten of these weapons were taken during camp searches, and 13 others were taken during civilian\n\nsearches in the sector. The G5 units deployed in this zone are to increase their activities to protect and secure civilian populations and their assets. The G5 Sahel covers a 5 million km\u00b2 space with a population of 60 million.\n\nTibesti, Borkou, Ennedi-ouest Chadian authorities to forcibly remove illegal goldminers: The Ministers of Public security, Territorial administration, Armed forces, and Oil and Mines, have been instructed to take all necessary measures to ensure \u201cthe immediate closure of all illegal goldmining sites across national territory\u201d, except for those already approved and certified by the mining sector. Such measures include the ousting of all goldminers from illegally occupied sites and the transfer of all illegal foreigners back to their countries of origin. Illegal goldmining has been formally forbidden across the country since 2016. The Government recalled that the decision to ban illegal\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nOCHA operational updates | 2\n\ngold mining activities had been issued to the illegal miners in the Tibesti province in the aftermath of the attacks\n\nby the CCMSR rebel movement in 2018. Despite these orders, illegal goldmining has been ongoing in the northern provinces of Chad (Tibesti, Borkou, Ennedi), resulting in frequent clashes between goldminers and rebel groups. Back in June, miners and bandits clashed near the border with Libya, resulting in 24 dead and several wounded. The North of Chad, remote and difficult to control, has also recorded a surge in deportations of Chadians from Libya, arriving in dire conditions and in urgent need of food, water and shelter. During the month of September alone, 129 cases of deportation were reported, bringing the total recorded since April 2020 to 802.

DTM identified an additional 330 internally displaced families (approximately 1,650\n\nindividuals) since the previous report, bringing the total number of internally displaced persons from Murzuq to at least\n\n760 families (approximately 3,800 individuals) who have been forced to leave their homes due to armed conflict since the beginning of August. Furthermore, around 250 migrants from Niger, Chad and Nigeria were reportedly also displaced from\n\nThe majority of IDPs are currently staying with host families and in private accommodation in Sebha, Ubari, Wadi Etba, Al Gatroun, Taraghin and safer neighborhoods in Murzuq, while at least 425 IDPs are currently hosted in seven collective shelters in Wadi Etba. Humanitarian priority needs reported by field observers include medical supplies and health\n\nassistance, followed by food, WASH and NFIs (diapers, mattresses, blankets, solar lamps, cleaning materials and hygiene kits). Apart from humanitarian needs for internally displaced persons, the non-displaced host community in Murzuq has also been adversely affected by the ongoing conflict, market closures and impact on public infrastructure and services\n\n(please refer to following sections for more details).\n\nFollowing the escalation of conflict during the first week of August, most local markets in Murzuq City were reported to be closed, including food markets and bakeries leading to shortages of key food items, including bread, rice, pasta, couscous, beans, tuna, tomatoes and vegetable oil. Reportedly, many households were relying on prepositioned food stocks to meet\n\ntheir daily needs as well as commodities purchased on informal markets at substantial price markups.\n\nGiven constrained market availability, limited affordability, cash shortages and heavily constrained public services in conjunction with fuel shortages (see next section), households in Murzuq were reported to be increasingly struggling to meet their daily needs. Commuting time to other municipalities with open markets was reported to be up to two hours\n\nand constrained by prevailing fuel shortages, intermittent road closures and security concerns.\n\nWASH: Public water and sanitation services were reported to be mostly unavailable; the primary source of water was reported to be water wells operating on generator-powered pumps, reportedly leading to severe price increases for water on informal\n\nInfrastructure: Major electricity outages were reported across neighborhoods in Murzuq as well damage to buildings due to armed conflict.\n\nFuel: Fuel shortages, already reported prior to the escalation of violence, were reportedly further exacerbated by the current crisis as well as increased demand due to limited public service provision.\n\nEducation: Schools were reported to be closed in the first week of August. Health: Health services were reported to be severely constrained in Murzuq, both in terms of availability of medical supplies for chronic diseases as well as medical assistance for acute cases.\n\nAccess: The primary road connection between Sebha and Murzuq was reported to be closed. According to field observers, roads between Murzuq and Wadi Etba remained accessible, with possibility of onward transport from Wadi Etba to Ubari and\n\nInformation on markets, public services and infrastructure in Murzuq were collected by DTM through interviews with 11 key informants between 08 and 11 August 2019. In terms of availability of services, provision of almost all essential services such as education, electricity, health, and water were reported to be negatively affected by the conflict.\n\nWadi Etba\n\nAl Gatroun\n\nIDPs displaced within Murzuq",

From 9 to 10 December, a joint UNICEF/WFP workshop was organized in Senegal on the implementation of the UNICEF/WFP concept note to strengthen the collaboration at country level in different areas, namely nutrition, school feeding, and resilience. The objective of the workshop was to take stock of the implementation of the joint programme, identifying successes and challenges and to generate orientations and recommendations to inform the development of the partnership in 2021.\n\nOperational Updates\n\n\u2022 In view of rising COVID-19 cases in Niger, the United Nations country team (UNCT) in Niger has reinstated teleworking modality to minimize the spread of COVID-19 among UN staff. As such, all WFP Niger staff have been instructed to work from home from 14 December for an initial one-month period, except for a few staff who can only fulfil their duties from the office (location- \u2022 In response to an increase in reported COVID-19 cases, the Government ordered the closing of schools in Niger from 17 December to 4 January 2021. WFP in Niger is organizing school feeding activities in 922 schools targeting 155,000 beneficiaries, including cash grants for adolescent girls and direct cash transfers in some of the schools. A second training of trainers\u2019 session for the School Connect project (a digital platform to access information related to school meals activities in real time) was held on 30 December. \u2022 Community-based nutrition activities (such as cooking demonstrations and sensitization sessions at the Nutritional Rehabilitation Center) that were suspended since April due to COVID-19 restrictions, resumed progressively in small groups. \u2022 The recent attack by a non-state armed group in Diffa (on 12 December) has caused the internal displacement of more than 1,500 households (approximately 11,000 people) in the region. Through the Rapid Response Mechanism, WFP prepared three months of food assistance for the affected and host populations and nutrition prevention activities for children aged 6-23 months. All the 1,500 households targeted were reached. \u2022 WFP has reached over 240,000 flood-affected people through food and cash distributions in Diffa, Tahoua, Zinder, Maradi, Agadez and Tillabery regions as part of the first round of planned distributions and the second round of the distribution is almost completed as well.\n\n\u2022 Provide an integrated food and nutrition assistance to crisis-affected populations (refugees, IDPs, host communities and returnees)\n\n\u2022 Provide an integrated school feeding package to boys, girls and adolescents during the school year in a way that relies on and stimulates local production (home-grown school feeding)\n\n\u2022 Support national nutrition programme through provision of preventive and curative nutrition services (including SBCC, local food fortification, complementary feeding and capacity strengthening) to targeted\n\n\u2022 Provide livelihood support to food insecure and at-risk men, women, boys and girls, including the development or rehabilitation of natural and productive assets (FFA), climate risk management measures, and value chains.\n\n\u2022 Provide capacity strengthening to national, decentralised institutions and partners on: (i) coherent and gender-transformative intersectoral policies; ii) planning, (ii) coordination mechanisms, (iii) ownership and programme implementation, and (iv) knowledge management.",

Situation Update\n\nAccording to the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), flood waters continue to decrease, leading to increasing movement of people, including in and around Chimoio. However, it will still take some time for the rivers to recede below the medium alert level in most areas. Key areas being monitored for potential new flooding are Marromeu, Nhamatanda, Muanza, Mopeia and Maganja da Costa districts in Sofala and Zambezia Provinces.\n\nThe risk of water-borne and vector-borne diseases remains a major concern, with reports of rising cases of malaria, in addition to cases of cholera and acute diarrhea. Beira and Dondo are both cholera endemic areas in Mozambique and the risk of spread is high.\n\nThe ramp in Beira airport was saturated on the evening of Thursday 29 March. The handling capacity at the airport is stretched. Partners are encouraged to share their upstream pipeline of cargo with the Logistics Cluster to coordinate and avoid bottlenecks. The Logistics Cluster recommends partners with no critical cargo to send it to Maputo and transport it by road to Beira.\n\nTo ensure a seamless provision of common services, the Logistics Cluster requires partners to submit their Service Request Forms at least 24 hours in advance. Cut-off time for requests is 14:00 for services to be provided the following day.\n\n2. Logistics operations\n\nAir operations\n\nOn 29 March and 30 March, the Logistics Cluster facilitated offloading of two cargo planes from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in Beira carrying relief cargo from the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), Caritas, International Organization for Migration (IOM) and UKAid. In addition, the Logistics Cluster in Beira offloaded humanitarian cargo from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Spanish Cooperation Agency (AECID).\n\nIn Maputo, due to an issue related to the airport High-Loader, several flights carrying heavy tonnage were diverted directly to Beira airport. The High-Loader at the Maputo airport is still under repair works.\n\nOn 29 March the Logistics Cluster in Chimoio received 7.5 mt of WASH and Nutrition humanitarian cargo. The WASH items were stored at the Logistics Cluster warehouse for incoming deliveries in Dombe.\n\nThe Logistics Cluster facilitated loading WFP food supplies on the WFP-contracted C-295 cargo plane in Chimoio to reach Espungabera, a location close to the Zimbabwe border still difficult to access.\n\nOn 30 March, the Logistics Cluster transported IOM\u2019s Non-Food Items (NFIs) and WFP\u2019s food supplies by helicopter from Beira to Buzi, including equipment to establish a Samaritan\u2019s Purse field clinic.\n\nThe Logistics Cluster is currently compiling requests to move cargo on the C-130 cargo plane provided by USAID form Maputo to Beira. Partners should send their SRFs to Mozambique.clustercargo@wfp.org.\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nSituation Update, 30 March 2019 Mozambique: Tropical Cyclone Idai\n\nSea ports Beira, Maputo and Quelimane sea ports are operational. Road access The latest road access constrains map is available here. \u2022 The road to Buzi is still not passable and only accessible by boat and air. \u2022 The road between Chimoio and Dombe is open for light vehicles. \u2022 The road between Maganja da Costa and Sopa, one of the affected areas in Zambezia province, is not \u2022 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) have started using the common storage space in Chimoio and the Logistics Cluster is expecting incoming cargo from Swiss Humanitarian Aid, UNHCR and UNFPA in the coming days. \u2022 The Logistics Cluster is facilitating three 40 ft containers and a 500 m2 MSU at Beira airport to ensure an efficient loading of helicopters. Three Mobile Storage Units (MSUs) are also available for partners at the WFP warehouse in Beira with a total capacity of 1,000 m2 approximately. \u2022 Logistics Emergency Teams (LET) partners have made available containers for the Logistics Cluster and can provide additional capacity if requested. The Logistics Cluster will facilitate access to these. \u2022 Partners interested in requesting storage services from the Logistics Cluster can refer to the SOPs available on the website. Railway operations Railway services between Moatize (Tete province) and Beira are operational. \u2022 The Beira-Chimoio railway services remain not functional. However, repair works have started on this line. \u2022 The Machipanda line to Zimbabwe is operational. Power services are functional in certain areas of Beira, including some hospitals. The national Mozambique power company (EDM) is working on restoring services in the affected areas and announced that the sub- station of Munhava, the main sub-station in Beira, is operational.",

It prioritized the decentralization of response activities to the health district\n\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing is possible in nine out of ten regions and rapid (TDR) testing is available in all regions. The Ministry of health set up fifteen laboratories in all regions of the country to facilitate the\n\nscreening process. With the support of the World Health Organization (WHO), trainings of laboratory technicians were organized all over the country.\n\nThe average number of weekly positive cases has Frankline Sevidzem is an epidemiologist working for COVID-19 decreased from 510 in July/August 2020 to 260 by 30 October. With the decline of the number of COVID-19 positive cases, the Government of Cameroon dismantled three makeshift hospitals in Douala\u2019s Mbappe Leppe stadium (Littoral region), in Limbe Middle Farms stadium (South-West region) and in Yaound\u00e9 Ngoa-Ekell\u00e9 stadium (Centre region), among the eight COVID-19 treatment centers constructed to give an adequate and timely response in all the regions. Yet, Centre and Littoral regions remain the epicenters of the pandemic with the highest number of new positive cases among the general population as well as among medical staff.\n\nUNICEF is supporting the risk communication and community engagement response through sensitization activities in\n\ncommunities, mass media and local radios and by conducting surveys in order to better adapt the message. Althought the Government with the support of partners is still conducting voluntary testing campaigns and encouraging the respect of barrier measures, general opinion among the population is that there is no longer a COVID-19 epidemic in Cameroon. \u201cNow that the dismantling of the isolation and treatment centers in response to the Coronavirus has been announced, we already\n\nknow that the disease is gone, no one wears his mask anymore nowadays, taxis drivers are overloading their vehicles with passengers again, life goes on\u201d said Jules Zebaze, a thirty-year-old street seller in Yaounde.\n\nTo limit the damage and ensure that the country does not experience a second phase of infections, it is necessary to intensify awareness activities.\n\nBACK TO SCHOOL BUT NOT FOR ALL CHILDREN IN CAMEROON\n\nOn 5 October 2020, millions of students returned to school in Cameroon after seven months of school closure due to control measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nCredit: UNICEF\n\nTo ensure the safe reopening of schools and prevent the spread of COVID-19 , the Ministry of Basic Education and the Ministry of Secondary Education have put in place a\n\npart-time class system for schools with high enrolment of students so that each classroom does not exceed a maximum of fifty students at a given time. Schools are implementing preventive measures such as the wearing of\n\nmasks, temperature controls at the entrace and providing water and hygiene facilities to wash hands.\n\nNot all students in Cameroon had however the chance to resume school in October.\n\nIn the North-West and South-West regions where the security situation and living conditions are deteriorating because of violence, more than 4,000 schools were destroyed or closed, leaving 700,000 students without access to education since the start of the crisis in 2017. Since 5 October 2020 schools have gradualy started to re-open, although regular Monday ghost towns did not facilitate the resumption of lessons. During the first week of the school year, school attendance was",

    "text": "35819\n\nSyria \u2013 Complex Emergency AUGUST 12, 2020\n\n1 USAID\u2019s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/BHA) 2 Total USAID/BHA funding includes non-food humanitarian assistance from the former Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance and emergency food assistance from the former\n\nOffice of Food for Peace.\n\n3 U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (State/PRM) 4 Total does not include supplemental FY 2020 funding through USAID/BHA and State/PRM for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) preparedness and response activities.\n\nKEY DEVELOPMENTS\n\nUNSC Partially Renews UN Cross-Border Authorization for Syria\n\nOn July 11, the UN Security Council (UNSC) partially renewed the cross-border authorization that enables UN agencies to deliver aid into Syria from neighboring countries. The resolution that passed,\n\nUNSC Resolution 2533, allows UN agencies to continue operating cross-border through Turkey\u2019s Bab al-Hawa (BaH) crossing for one year, while removing UN authorization for Turkey\u2019s Bab al-Salama (BaS) crossing. Through BaH, UN agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have reached nearly\n\n1.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Idlib Governorate with humanitarian assistance, while UN agencies and NGOs have reached an estimated additional 1.3 million people, including at least 800,000 IDPs in northern Aleppo Governorate through BaS, the UN reports. Despite additional access\n\nchallenges, the UN and NGOs are adapting activities to continue delivering assistance to vulnerable populations previously reached by the UN through BaS.\n\nVulnerable populations in opposition-held areas of northwest Syria do not receive cross-line assistance from Syrian Arab Republic Government (SARG)-held areas and must rely exclusively on cross-border assistance from UN agencies, NGOs, and other humanitarian actors. As such, the lack of UN access to\n\nBaS creates logistical, operational, and security challenges for humanitarian actors, the UN reports, placing additional strain on organizations using the BaH crossing to reach populations previously accessed through BaS. However, NGOs, including USAID/BHA partners, do not require UNSC\n\nauthorization to deliver assistance cross-border, and can largely continue operations via BaS.\n\nHealth Actors Monitor Significant Increase in COVID-19 Cases Across Syria\n\nFrom early July to August, health actors recorded a fourfold increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases across Syria, rising from approximately 300 to more than 1,300 confirmed cases countrywide. As of August 11, the SARG Ministry of Health had confirmed 1,327 cases, including 53 resultant deaths, in\n\nSARG-held areas. Additionally, as of August 12, health actors had confirmed 47 COVID-19 cases in opposition-held areas of Aleppo and Idlib, following the northwest region\u2019s first reported case on July 9, according to the Early Warning, Alert, and Response Network, a disease surveillance system comprising\n\nlocal health authorities, the UN World Health Organization (WHO), and other health stakeholders. As of August 12, the Syria-based Kurdish Self Administration had confirmed 144 cases in northeast Syria\u2019s Aleppo, Dayr az Zawr, Al Hasakah, and Ar Raqqah governorates, including seven deaths. Several\n\nconfirmed cases are medical staff in Al Hasakah\u2019s Al Hol camp, which hosted approximately 64,700 people as of early August, more than 50 percent of whom are children younger than 12 years of age.\n\nHealth actors remain particularly concerned by the spread of COVID-19 in northern Syria due to the weak health care system and large IDP population residing in congested camps with poor water,\n\nsanitation, and hygiene (WASH) conditions and limited access to health care services. The increase in cases countrywide, particularly those with unknown or untraceable exposure, represents potential widespread community transmission in parts of Syria, the UN reports. In response to the recent rise in\n\ncases, health authorities, particularly in northern Syria, have revised COVID-19 mitigation measures and re-imposed movement restrictions in some areas.",

In the context of an interagency coordination\n\nframework in Syria, UNHCR leads the Protection and Community Services, Shelter and Non-Food Items sectors together with relevant line ministries.\n\nStrategic Directions UNHCR\u2019s strategic directions and operational priorities in Syria are:\n\nPrepare for and respond to potential influx of internally displaced persons (IDPs) refugees, IDP and refugee returnees. Foster an environment for voluntary, dignified, safe and sustainable return of\n\nrefugees and IDPs focussing on supporting those who have returned spontaneously and their communities.\n\nEnhance the protective environment for refugees and promote innovative solutions through a community and area-based approach. Strengthen delivery-focused partnerships to enable UNHCR achieve its\n\ninterventions through inter-agency and sector coordination mechanisms. This includes the Special Situations Group, UN Country Team, Humanitarian Country\n\nTeam, Return and Reintegration Working Group and Area Humanitarian Country\n\nMain Activities\n\nUNHCR\u2019s protection response strategy follows a community-based approach which aims to reduce vulnerabilities and protection risks. Through community participation and\n\noutreach, persons of concern receive psycho-social support, targeted assistance if they have specific needs, and child protection services. UNHCR and its partners provide legal assistance, including to help people obtain civil documentation and support them to\n\nregister civil events. At community centres, children can attend remedial classes and prepare for exams. Outreach volunteers engage communities to identify and address\n\nspecific protection concerns through small-scale community-led interventions or livelihood opportunities.\n\nUNHCR supports 89 community centres, 37 satellite centres and 109 mobile units in all 14 governorates of the country and engages over 2,600 outreach volunteers to strengthen UNHCR\u2019s protection activities.\n\nCash-Based Interventions UNHCR Syria uses cash-based interventions to help the most vulnerable refugees meet\n\ntheir most urgent needs. Monthly multi-purpose cash grants equivalent to around USD 40 per family are provided to refugees through an over-the-counter modality. Similarly,\n\neligible refugee families receive education grants to encourage school attendance by covering costs of transport, uniforms and education materials.\n\nFACT SHEET / SYRIA / JUNE 2021",

The Rapid Response Mechanism in Libya has been activated on 11 April, and within two days already reached 2,000 individuals with a key package that includes hygiene kits, dignity kits, NFI kits and food rations.\n\nSituation Overview\n\nSignificant numbers of civilians remain stuck in areas affected by conflict, such as Sawani, Azizia, Qasr Ben Ghashir, Khallet Forjan, Ain Zara and Wadi Al-Rabee, unable to move to comparatively safer areas. To date, first responders have received some 881 requests for evacuations. However, only 119 evacuations could be successfully conducted, and only eight of them occurred in the last 24 hours. This translates to some 4,500 people requesting their evacuation, with only 600 people managing to secure a safe exit. Low evacuation rates have been attributed to ongoing clashes, and reports of the indiscriminate and deliberate targeting of ambulance vehicles. Additionally, many doctors and ambulance drivers were reported to have pulled out of the rescue operations, citing the unsustainable risk they were exposed to.\n\nThe humanitarian community is concerned about rising numbers of civilian casualties, including medical personnel. Just yesterday, on 11 April, indiscriminate artillery shelling on densely populated and residential areas in Al-Swani in the southern outskirts of Tripoli resulted in the death of one civilian and three injuries, two of whom remain in critical condition. Within just in one week, three medical personnel have been killed and five ambulances have been incapacitated by shrapnel. In a statement today, the Humanitarian Coordinator has reminded all parties to the conflict of their obligation to prevent harm to civilians, safeguard civilian infrastructure and to ensure safe, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access by emergency services and aid workers to all affected people.\n\nDisplacement numbers continue to steadily increase. As per DTM, since the onset of armed conflict on 05 April 2019, over 13,500 individuals have been displaced. This includes the recent displacement of some 4,000 individuals within the last 24 hours. Most displaced households are currently staying with family and acquaintances or in private accommodation. Key reception areas are Tripoli, Tajoura, Swani, and Janzour, amidst other locations. The number of IDPs identified in collective shelters in Tripoli and surrounding areas has increased to over 900 individuals, and local authorities are setting up additional shelters to receive displaced families.\n\nHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE\n\nThe humanitarian community remains committed to assist those in Libya in need of assistance during this time of crisis. Yesterday, on 11 April, the first delivery under the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) has been successfully conducted. The RRM is an operational and programmatic partnership model designed to enhance capacity of the Sectors to respond in a timely, coordinated and standardised manner to the needs of populations made vulnerable by displacement and other factors.\n\nThe RRM was launched in Libya to support the provision of assistance to IDPs, migrants, and besieged populations with life-saving supplies that can enhance their resilience during a time of crisis. Already on its first day of activation, the RRM reached around 1,000 individuals. RRM activities will be carried out in conflict-affected areas, reaching displaced populations in urban areas and in collective shelters.",

    "text": "52022\n\nSince the beginning of 2020, more than 3.26 million refugees and migrants from Venezuela \u2013 as well as members of host communities \u2013 were assisted with one or more service by R4V partners, including assistance relating to needs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. While some countries relaxed mobility restrictions related to COVID-19 during the reporting period, refugees and migrants from Venezuela faced pressing needs in accessing food, shelter and adequate housing, and difficulties adhering to sanitary measures, especially due to overcrowded accommodations and a lack of access to hygienic facilities and lack of income to purchase basic household and hygiene items.\n\nBy 8 October, National and Sub-Regional Platforms submitted their projections of populations, persons in need and corresponding financial requirements of R4V partners for consolidation of the Regional Refugee and Migrants Response Plan (RMRP) 2021 at the regional level. From October until December, the Regional Platform worked with National and Sub-regional Platforms to finalize their chapters, including to consolidate all narrative and data overview sections. The RMRP 2021 was finalized and formally presented to the Regional Platform on 1 December. On 10 December 2020, the RMRP 2021 was launched in a virtual high-level panel event featuring IOM Director General Ant\u00f3nio Vitorino and UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, which was broadcasted internationally to more than 1,200 participants. The RMRP 2021 reflects the joint planning of 159 appealing humanitarian and development partners in 17 countries and aims to assist 3.3 million refugees and migrants from Venezuela and host community members, based on a cumulative financial requirement of USD 1.44 billion. Similar to the 2020 focus, the 2021 RMRP will maintain its three main response priorities in the areas of: i) humanitarian assistance, ii) protection and iii) integration.\n\nIn late November, R4V partners, particularly those forming part of the Protection sector and the GBV sub-sector, joined efforts with local authorities across the region to celebrate the 16 days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence (details below on country-specific activities). Throughout the reporting period, reports of GBV increased and the regional GBV sub-sector worked to guide partners\u2019 efforts towards a response adapted to the COVID-19 situation, such as using remote assistance methods for children and women survivors of GBV.\n\nMain Developments\n\nIn Brazil, entry restrictions for foreign nationals were extended indefinitely. The relating decree explicitly stated that exceptions (e.g. for family reunification or migratory visa status) would not apply to Venezuelans. Failure to comply can lead to deportation and disqualification of asylum claims submitted in violation of the aforementioned rule. On 19 October, the Federal Police extended all documents of refugees and migrants that expired after 11 March 2020 until 16 March 2021,\n\nprovided that the individual remained within the country throughout this period. On 13 November, the Ministry of Education issued Resolution n. 1 on the right to enrolment of children and adolescent refugees, migrants, stateless persons and asylum seekers in the Brazilian public education system. The resolution establishes that, when requested, the enrolment of said children and adolescents shall be ensured without\n\nPEOPLE REACHED IN\n\nFood Hum.

In October, for example, the hospital bed occupancy rate in Tarapaca reached 97%. According to the Ministry of the Interior and Public Security, between January and November 2020, 13,656 people entered the country through irregular border points (75% of them Venezuelans). Meanwhile, Chile was one of the first countries in the region to receive the vaccine",

    "text": "5968\n\n21 - 28 September 2018\n\nUNHCR FLASH UPDATE\n\nPopulation Movements\n\nAs of 24 September 2018, 55,612 asylum-seekers and refugees are registered with UNHCR in Libya. In addition, there are some 6,800 refugees and migrants detained in Libya, of whom 3,700 are of concern to UNHCR. UNHCR continues to advocate for alternatives to detention in Libya. UNHCR\u2019s refugee protection mandate, however, necessitates that the Office has access to detention centres for the purpose of monitoring conditions, providing humanitarian assistance, identifying those in need of international protection and advocating for their release from detention.\n\nAs of 27 September, the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG) rescued/intercepted 13,575 refugees and migrants (9,289 men, 2,085 women and 1,345 children) at sea during 101 operations. Since the beginning of the year, 99 bodies were recovered in Libyan waters while 608 lives were lost at sea.\n\nOver the past month, heavy fighting in Tripoli resulted in the displacement of some 5,000 families (IDPs), including 1,700 in the past week alone. According to the Libyan Ministry of Health, 115 people were killed and 560 injured since the fighting began in August.\n\nUNHCR Response\n\nUNHCR and its partner LibAid provided humanitarian assistance to 540 families who were displaced in Zawia, Surman and Tarhuna as a result of recent clashes in Tripoli. UNHCR provided core relief items (CRIs) including blankets, sleeping mats, hygiene kits, diapers and solar lamps. Since the beginning of the clashes on 26 August, UNHCR and LibAid provided humanitarian assistance to over 1,000 families (5,478 individuals) in and around Tripoli.\n\nOn 23 September, UNHCR and LibAid distrubuted CRIs including blankets, sleeping mats, quilts, solar lamps, kitchen sets, hygiene kits and plastic sheets to 980 displaced and returnee families (6,590 individuals) in Benghazi. Benghazi is the baladiya with the highest number of returnees in Libya (180,300 returnees as of June 2018). Over the past months, Benghazi received 2,990 new IDPs, many of them displaced from Derna where heavy clashes were reported in May and June.\n\nUNHCR continues to implement quick-impact projects (QIPs) throughout Libya. So far in 2018, UNHCR implemented 83 QIPs. In Benghazi, UNHCR and its partner ACTED rehabilitated public spaces in Al Sabri district which were in need of repair after the war. With the help of the Scouts, UNHCR and its partner cleaned the streets, painted the side-walks and completed the installation of reflective street signs. In addition, in Misrata, UNHCR and its partner Mercy Corps supported the Scouts with camping and recreational equipment to promote social cohesion and youth events. Misrata ranks second in terms of displacement, with 15% of displacement in the country occurring in this baladiya. Misrata is among the 15 mantikas considered as in acute and immediate need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nAs of 24 September 2018, 12 States have committed 3,886 resettlement places resettlement directly from Libya, whereas 2,796 places are allocated for evacuees from Libya and refugees registered in Niger. UNHCR continues to advocate for refugees in Libya.\n\nSpecial thanks to major donors:\n\nCanada | Denmark | European Union | Finland | France | Germany | Italy | Japan | Norway | Sweden| Switzerland |The Netherlands | United Kingdom | USA | Private Donors\n\nKey Figures people of concern 55,612 registered refugees & asylum-seekers 192,513* internally displaced persons 372,741* IDP returnees\n\nUNHCR Coordinated Sectors\n\nShelter & NFI Sector Cash & Markets Working Group (Co-led by UNHCR & IOM)\n\nKey Achievements in 2018\n\n29,412 medical consultations ( 35,091 in 2017) 60,804 IDPs and refugees received non-food items (113,605 in 2017) 83 Quick Impact Projects implemented in 2018\n\n3,534 IDP and refugee households received cash assistance (3,314 in 2017)\n\n19,184 individuals registered since 2016 (11,023 in 2018)\n\n9,819 rescue kits and 1,497 medical consultations provided at disembarkation points (5,327 and 2,956 in 2017)",

It continues to this day, with exported cases reaching the UK, Israel and Singa- pore.2 Prior to this outbreak, the disease was last reported in Nigeria in 1978.4 Monkeypox is an orthopox virus, closely related to smallpox, that produces vesico- papular lesions on the skin. Symptoms are usually self- limiting and most people recover within weeks. Severe illness and death usually only occurs among immunosuppressed\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The outbreak generated front page headlines, with one title describing it as a \u2018new airborne Ebola\u2019.6 A European headline (from the Voice of Europe) was \u2018Horrible Nigerian disease called monkeypox spreads in the United Kingdom for the first time\u2019. The media used unverified pictures of people with skin rashes, to amplify their messages.7 There may be substantial discrepancies between what the National Public Health Institute responsible for outbreak response coordination aims to communicate during epidemics, and what the media actually disseminates.8 This can exacerbate public uncertainty and distrust. Globally, the response to outbreaks of severe acute respi- ratory syndrome and avian influenza, releases of anthrax and sarin, and natural disasters such as the South- East Asian tsunami, demon- strated the importance of communication during public health emergencies.10 Subsequently, particular focus has been\n\nplaced on strengthening the capacity for Correspondence to risk communication within relevant govern- Oyeronke Oyebanji; oyeronke. oyebanji@ ncdc. gov. ng ment institutions. However, such capacity is\n\nstill evolving in many low/middle- income countries, including Nigeria where event- based surveillance is enhancing the existing indicator- based surveillance system. It uses information from the internet and other channels including phone calls, text messages, Whatsapp messages and others.11 The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) \u2014 Nigeria's National Public Health Institute \u2014 uses a proprietary internet crawling system called \u2018Tatafo\u2019, which gener- ates unstructured event- based reports from 350 media sites (webs, newspapers, television, blogs/online media and social media). The system uses keywords including the 41 noti- fiable diseases as outlined in the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response guide- lines.12 Searches on this system are automated, but can also be moderated for key conditions.

    "text": "21553\n\nIn June, the number of refugees and migrants from Venezuela reached the 4 million worldwide, with 3.2 million hosted in Latin America and the\n\n4 Million Venezuelans worldwide\n\nThe financial contributions towards the RMRP reached a 21% of the total requirements in June. A still low funding percentage towards the USD 737.6M requested in the Plan.\n\nNew entry requirements were implemented by Chile and Peru, while registration exercises took place in Trinidad and Tobago and\n\n3.2 Million Venezuelans living in Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nPage 1 of 6\n\nRegional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform > Situation Report \u2013 May/June 2019\n\nArea of Intervention 1: Direct emergency assistance Strategic outcome: Refugees and migrants are provided with life-saving goods and services.\n\nNeeds Assessments\n\nMonitoring exercises were conducted in Ecuador in partnership with the Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion (MIES). Results indicate that almost 40% of the 1,682 Venezuelan national interviewees report being in an irregular situation, while more than 37% indicated having a tourist visa or a \u201ctarjeta andina\u201d. The proportion of out-of-school children reported was of 41% of children aged between 5 to 11 and 53% of those aged 12 to 17 years.\n\nBasic Needs and Essential Services\n\nPartners have provided assistance to more than 8,000 refugees and migrants from Venezuela in Peru, Guyana, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, Argentina, Uruguay, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nTransportation assistance was provided to over 5,500 refugees and migrants from the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border to CEBAF and Tumbes, where approximately one fifth were referred to shelter support. More than 11,000 food and non- food kits were also provided in Peru.\n\nIn the area of food and nutrition, partners in the Caribbean (Guyana, Aruba, Curacao and Trinidad and Tobago) reached approximately 1,300 refugees and migrants from Venezuela with basic food and/or water. Temporary accommodation was also provided to 96 vulnerable refugees and migrants in Curacao, Dominican Republic, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. In the Southern Cone (Argentina and Uruguay), on the other hand, almost 40 refugees and migrants from Venezuela were provided with temporary accommodation and food assistance.\n\nHealth Services\n\nThe provision of emergency health services and assistance is a pressing need among Venezuelans across the region. In the Dominican Republic, 562 Venezuelans benefitted from individual medical consultations. In Guyana, 787 Venezuelans were immunized and vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), Yellow Fever and diphtheria before being granted stay permits. In Trinidad and Tobago, partners distributed 14 dignity kits to 13 Venezuelan and one Cuban woman, and 97 Venezuelans (75 women, 1 girl and 21 men) accessed sexual reproductive health services. In Panama, partners provided medicines (along with food vouchers and housing support) to 16 Venezuelan families, 73 persons received psychosocial assistance.\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\nRegional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform > Situation Report \u2013 May/June 2019\n\nOrientation and Information\n\nIn Costa Rica, information was provided regarding the possibility for migrant and refugee children to access to the national education system. Among these, partners selected 20 Venezuelan children - based on vulnerability criteria - and provided them with uniforms and school supplies. Partners also provided tutoring and academic support to primary and secondary students to help them enter the Costa Rican educational system.\n\nIn Mexico, partners launched an information campaign called \u201cConnecting Communities\u201d through social media sites. It included information on how to obtain work permits, carry out family reunification, access to basic education and revalidating academic degrees. The campaign is estimated to have reached an audience of over 90,000 persons.\n\nArea of Intervention 2: Protection Strategic outcome: Refugees and migrants enjoy rights and protection.",

    "text": "6116\n\n28 Sep.- 5 Oct. 2018\n\nUNHCR FLASH UPDATE\n\nOn 1 October, the High Commissioner, Filipo Grandi, called on States to work more closely to find solutions for refugees. Grandi noted that thousands of individuals continue to cross the Sahel into Libya and across the Central Mediterranean to Europe \u201cdriven by despair, and exposed to unthinkable cruelty\n\nand dangers.\u201d He called for access to asylum in Europe to be preserved. \u201cRescue at sea,\u201d he said, \u201chas been taken hostage by politics. Responsibility-sharing has been replaced by responsibility-shifting.\u201d Highlighting UNHCR\u2019s protection work in Libya, he reported that an evacuation programme has flown close to 1,850 refugees and asylum seekers to safety, most to Niger, with the aim of onward resettlement, alongside a programme for the voluntary return of migrants carried out by the International Organization for Migration. He emphasised the need for more evacuation options, resettlement places and strategic investments to tackle the conflicts and development\n\nPopulation Movements\n\nAs of 4 October, the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG) rescued/intercepted 13,898 refugees and migrants (9,560 men, 2,118 women and 1,364 children) at sea during 104 operations. This is an increase of 12.3% compared to the same period in 2017. Since the beginning of the year, 99 bodies were recovered in Libyan waters while 608 lives were lost at sea. Most of the individuals disembarked were Nigerian (1,830 individuals), Sudanese (1,765 individuals) and Eritrean (1,532 individuals).\n\nThere are 55,877 refugees and asylum-seekers registered with UNHCR in Libya. The majority of refugees registered comprise of Palestinians (5,312 individuals) and Iraqis (2,462 individuals), while the majority of asylum-seekers comprise of Syrians (23,203 individuals) and Sudanese nationals (9,409 individuals). In 2018, 11,291 refugees and asylum-seekers were registered by UNHCR through its Community Day Centres and registration office. Last week alone, UNHCR registered 182 individuals, mainly from Sudan and Eritrea.\n\nMost of the 5,000 families who were displaced in Tripoli due to recent clashes have returned to their homes with the exception of families whose houses were severely damaged.\n\nUNHCR Response\n\nUNHCR is present in Tripoli with both national and international staff. At present, operational capacity is reduced, with the full scope of activities to resume as soon as security conditions permit.\n\nSince 1 September 2017, 897 individuals were submitted for resettlement to 8 States (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland). A total of 70 individuals departed on resettlement directly from Libya to Canada, France, the Netherlands and Sweden. As of 1 October 2018, 12 States have committed a total of 3,886 resettlement places for the Libya-Niger situation. These States are: Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Out of these pledges, 1,090 will be used for resettlement processing directly out of Libya, while 2,796 places will be allocated to evacuees from Libya and refugees registered in Niger.\n\nSpecial thanks to major donors: Canada | Denmark | European Union | Finland | France | Germany | Italy | Japan | Norway | Sweden| Switzerland |The Netherlands | United Kingdom | USA | Private\n\nKey Figures people of concern 55,877 registered refugees & asylum-seekers 192,513* internally displaced persons 372,741* IDP returnees\n\nUNHCR Coordinated Sectors\n\nShelter & NFI Sector Cash & Markets Working Group (Co-led by UNHCR & IOM)\n\nKey Achievements in 2018 29,712 35,091 in 2017) 63,452 IDPs and refugees received non-food items (113,605 in 2017) 83 Quick Impact Projects implemented in 2018 3,593 IDP and refugee households received cash assistance (3,314 in 2017) 19,452 individuals registered since 2016 (11,291 in 2018) 10,006 rescue kits and 1,497 medical (5,327 and 2,956 in 2017) (1,080 in 2017) 1,784 detained refugees/asylum-seekers released (1,428 in 2017) 2,755 refugees and asylum-seekers reached with submissions to third countries and 1,858 individuals evacuated from Libya ( 1,536 to Niger, 312 to Italy and 10 to Romania) UNHCR Funding Requirements USD 85 million required in 2018 * IOM-DTM",

    "text": "26310\n\nFebruary \ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd:\ufffd\ufffdAM EST Available In English Espa\u00f1ol\n\nVenezuela: Violent Abuses in Illegal Gold Mines Credible Allegations of Government Involvement, Acquiescence\n\n\u201cPoor Venezuelans driven to work in gold mining by the ongoing economic crisis and humanitarian emergency have become victims of macabre crimes by armed groups that control illegal mines in southern Venezuela,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at\n\nHuman Rights Watch. \u201cIt is critical for gold buyers and refineries to ensure that any Venezuelan gold in their supply chains is not stained with the blood of Venezuelan victims.\u201d\n\nThe operations of these illegal mines are also having a devastating impact on the environment and the health of workers, local sources said. Internal economic migration due to the economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela has increased the number of people\n\nseeking to work in mining areas. Many residents live in fear and are exposed to harsh working conditions, poor sanitation, and an extremely high risk of diseases such as malaria.\n\nIn October 2019, Human Rights Watch interviewed 21 people who had worked in mines or mining towns in Bol\u00edvar state in 2018 and 2019, including the mines near Las Claritas, El Callao, El Dorado, and El Algarrobo. In October and November, Human Rights Watch interviewed 15 other people, including leaders of indigenous groups in the area, journalists and experts who visited the area recently, and family members of people working in mines, and reviewed reports by independent groups and media outlets, which were consistent\n\nwith accounts from the people interviewed in the field. Human Rights Watch also reviewed satellite imagery that shows the growth of mining in this area.\n\nOverview of illegal mining sites in Sifontes Municipality, Bolivar State, Venezuela, accessed via https://mineria.amazoniasocioambiental.org/ on January 8, 2020. Location of the illegal mining sites is approximate and depends on the availability of satellite imagery and the information provided by third parties. \u00a9 2019 Portal Raisg - Miner\u00eda Ilegal\n\nSatellite image recorded as of January 3, 2020 shows the extension of Las Claritas mining site in Bolivar State, Venezuela. \u00a9 2020 Planet Labs\n\nNumerous people interviewed said that many mines in Bol\u00edvar are under the tight control of Venezuelan syndicates or Colombian armed groups. The International Crisis Group has reported that both the Colombian rebel group National Liberation Army (Ej\u00e9rcito\n\nde Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, ELN) and at least one dissident group that emerged from the demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC) operate in the area. Several people interviewed also said that these groups were active in Bol\u00edvar.\n\nPeople interviewed also said that Venezuelan authorities are aware of the illegal mining activities. Ten people who worked at the mines, two journalists covering the area, and a local indigenous leader said that state security agents have visited mining sites to collect bribes. Some of these sources said they witnessed this. Two people working in the mines and the indigenous leader, interviewed by Human\n\nRights Watch separately, claimed they saw a top official from the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro government visit the mines in different incidents.\n\nThe armed groups, who are effectively in charge of the mines and the settlements that have grown up around them, brutally enforce their rule. \u201cEveryone knows the rules,\u201d one resident said. \u201cIf you steal or mix gold with another product, the pran [the syndicate leader] will beat or kill you.\u201d Another said \u201cThey are the government there\u2026. If you steal, they \u2018disappear\u2019 you.\u201d\n\nAs detailed below, four residents said that they witnessed members of syndicates amputating or shooting the hands of people accused of stealing. Several other residents said they knew of cases in which syndicate members had cut offenders into pieces with a chainsaw, ax, or machete.\n\nResidents are also exposed to mercury, which miners use to extract the gold, despite it being prohibited in Venezuela. Mercury can cause serious health problems, even in small amounts, with toxic effects on the nervous, digestive, and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin, and eyes. Studies conducted in mining areas in Bol\u00edvar many years ago already found high levels of mercury exposure, including among women and children, for whom the health risks are even higher and, for pregnant women, include serious disability or death of the fetus and, if carried to term, the child.",

With current vaccine doses less than 2% of the population will receive a vaccine while in contrast rich nations have vaccinated their citizens at a rate of one person per second over the last\n\nThe first batch containing 300,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been distributed to various cities across Somalia. The vaccine\u2019s arrival comes as the country struggles with a second wave of COVID-19 cases. As WHO reported In Somalia, from 3 January 2020 to 23 March 2021, there have been 10,214 confirmed cases of COVID- 19 with 441 deaths, however testing capacity is low and the estimated real figures are much higher.\n\nUnder COVAX, Somalia will receive a total of 3.5 million doses, to vaccinate 20% of the population and 1.2million people can hope to be vaccinated by mid-year. Given the weak health care infrastructure, Somali health care workers will continue to struggle to treat those who need it if vaccines do not arrive in greater quantities more\n\n\u201cWhile the government has yet to announce the detail criteria for fair distribution of the vaccine, we urge the government to reach frontline health and humanitarian workers with preconditions as a priority as well as elderly or people with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, cancer, HIV, government personnel, marginalized groups including refugees, prisoners, and people living in slums and other crowded housing conditions,\u201d said Halimo Elmi, Acting Director of the Somali NGO Consortium\n\nThe UN has been allocated 1,000 vaccines and NGOs want to see local field teams at the front-line of the humanitarian responses to the escalating drought crisis and conflict-related displacement prioritised.\n\nMany of the economically developed nations rolling out vaccines quickly, including the US, UK and EU, have again blocked a proposal by over 100 developing countries, including Somalia, discussed at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on the anniversary of the pandemic last week. This proposal would override the monopolies held by pharmaceutical companies and allow an urgently needed scale up in the\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nproduction of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to ensure poorer countries, such as Somalia, get access to the doses they desperately need.\n\nQualified vaccine producers worldwide stand ready to produce more vaccines if they were allowed access to the technology and know-how, which now is being held under lock and key by pharmaceutical companies. This could bring new capacity on stream within months.\n\n\u201cThe inequality is outrageous. When rich countries and companies are not coming together to support those who are in need and put profits before people\u2019s health, it hurts us all. Somalis could be receiving many more doses this year if more labs were able to access the pharmaceutical blueprints,\u201d says Amjad Ali, Country Director of Oxfam in Somalia, which is part of The Peoples\u2019 Vaccine Alliance.\n\nTo control the virus, enough doses of vaccines need to be produced in different geographies, priced affordably, allocated globally and widely deployed for free in local communities. Thus far, the world is failing on all four fronts.\n\nMedia contacts: \u2022 For Somali enquiries: Abdiaziz Adani: +252 63 4411020, abdiaziz.adani@oxfam.org, Oxfam, Senior Advocacy Officer \u2022 For English enquiries: Amy Croome, amy.croome@oxfam.org, Chair of SNC\u2019s Advocacy Working Group \u2022 Abdisamad Yassin: comms@somaliangoconsortium.org, Somali NGO \u2022 Lillian Omariba, lillian_omariba@wvi.org, Chair of SNC\u2019s Communications Working Group",

With people typically queuing for hours to buy fuel, bread, and other necessities they\n\ncan barely afford, COVID-19 is a constant source of anxiety that only adds to concerns about where families might get their next meal from.\n\nAnas Almohammad, from Deir ez-Zor in Eastern Syria, is Food Security and Livelihoods (FSL) Cluster Co- Coordinator for the North West Syria hub, based in Turkey. Due to the conflict, he has not been able to visit his relatives since leaving in 2014. Having previously worked for the Ministry of Agriculture in Syria, he now leads the\n\nCluster\u2019s Agriculture technical working group and Bread and Bakeries coordination group, helping people to access\n\nbasic foods that would otherwise be out of reach.\n\nVoices from the field \u2013 Food Security Cluster\n\nFood distribution (left) and shopping with cards in Syria (right). Photo credit: WFP/Hussam Al Saleh\n\nFSC response in Syria\n\nAnas works for the FSL Cluster alongside national and international NGOs, collaborating with over 80 partners to assist communities across the country. He cites reaching those most at risk as what drives him most, with the FSC for the Whole of Syria and the FSL Cluster for North West Syria coordinating cash and voucher assistance, emergency\n\nfood distributions including much-needed bread and bakery products, and support households\u2019 resilience through\n\nagricultural programmes to boost production.\n\nWhile the majority of Syrians used to be able to earn an income and pay for their own food, farming inputs, education and health services, Anas says he is struck by how many have now lost their means of supporting themselves. \u201cThey rely almost entirely on humanitarian assistance and what family members can send back monthly from abroad. Most\n\nof my relatives from Deir ez-Zor are now internally displaced in the North West. Although some stayed at home, the situation there is very bad, with monthly salaries between USD 10 to USD 20 \u2013 anything they need to buy is impossibly\n\nNorth West Syria: an unfolding and protracted crisis\n\nAnas tells us that \u201cout of 4.4. million people in the North West region alone, 3.3 million are food insecure, including 2.7 million who have been internally displaced due to the conflict. Of these, 1.6 million are living in camps and are completely dependent on humanitarian assistance. They are highly vulnerable, and their cramped living conditions\n\nmake it easier for COVID-19 to circulate.\u201d Compelled to coordinate food security response remotely due to the pandemic, he cites flooding in IDP camps and\n\nfires in farming areas as added challenges for Syrians and humanitarian actors striving to help them. \u201cWith rural\n\npopulations forced to abandon their land and livelihoods, the resilience of the entire country is being dangerously\n\nVoices from the field \u2013 Food Security Cluster\n\nSyrians, including elderly people and children, queue for food parcels. Photo: WFP/ Hussam Al Saleh\n\nHelping the most vulnerable to help themselves \u201cThe most inspiring part of our work is helping people to help themselves, standing by those in need and supporting them. For this, all local and international partners come together as a great team, assisting communities\n\nacross the country.\u201d Despite the difficulties he witnesses every day, Anas hopes that over the next few years the Cluster can shift increasingly from emergency assistance and early recovery to resilience. \u201cIf investments and additional resources are made available, the Cluster will be able to further support coordination of agricultural production and livelihoods programmes. I have seen the difference that we and our partners are making to the everyday lives of",

    "text": "2952\n\nSituation Overview A tropical cyclone formed in the Gulf of Aden between Yemen and northern Somalia on 16 May 2018. The cyclone system caused heavy rains along the coast of Puntland on 17 May. Flash flooding was reported in the Bari region, which were not limited to seasonal riverbeds. The road linking Bossaso and points south has reportedly been affected. There are also reports of some fishing boats having been washed away by waves off the coast of Sanaag region, which along with Sool are disputed between Somaliland and Puntland. The two authorities have been engaged in an armed standoff in Sool that had displaced almost 10,000 people prior to the storms arrival, further complicating an already complex humanitarian picture. By 18 May, the cyclone had gained strength, reaching tropical storm-wind levels and assigned the name Tropical Cyclone Sagar. Heavy rains are projected for the escarpment and plateau of Somaliland.\n\nCyclone Sagar is expected to make landfall along the coastline of Somaliland during the afternoon of 19 May. Rains intensified on 18 May in most parts of Puntland and into Somaliland, with reprieve only expected on 21 May. Flash floods and strong winds will affect the two states during this time, according to the FAO-managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM). Somaliland and Puntland have experienced protracted drought dating back to Somaliland\u2019s original drought appeal issued on 10 August 2015, leaving them particularly prone to flash flooding due to massive downpours.\n\nHumanitarian impact and needs Authorities and humanitarians are closely monitoring the situation as it unfolds in Puntland and Somaliland. In Puntland State, heavy rainfall was observed in the northern region of Bari, with Bareeda, Caluula, Murcanyo, Gumbax, and some parts of Xaabo being amongst the worst affected areas. Around 35 houses and 15 small boats were destroyed, while 56 camels, nearly 1,260 goats and sheep and 19 donkeys died. In the ancient coastal town of Lasqoray, houses in Habarshiro and Ceel Buh were also affected by flash flooding. Huge ocean waves were experienced in coastal areas, with most of the affected people displaced or moved to higher ground. In Bossaso, an estimated 220 improvised shelters belonging to internally displaced people in Tawakal, were washed away. Some 30 boats were also destroyed in Caluula and another 20 small boats were destroyed at the Bossaso Seaport. Two deaths and one injury were reported at Labo Wanlay, a bridge situated approximately 40km south of Bossaso. In Iskushuban, a number of farms and water facilities were damaged and washed away by the heavy rainfall. Qardo and others towns were reportedly inundated by flash flooding.\n\nHeavy rains and strong winds have been reported in the coastal areas of Sanaag and Somaliland, according to reports received on the morning of 19 May. In Berber town, humanitarians reported one death and one serious injury after the storm destroyed homes. Some 125 families whose shelters were flooded were evacuated to nearby schools by the local authorities, with the support of the Somaliland Red Crescent Society. The affected people received blankets, sleeping mats, biscuits and water. In the village of Ceel Sheekh, some 15 shelters were also destroyed, with the communities fleeing to higher ground. There are, however, concerns regarding the fate of over 150 families living in the areas surrounding the town. In Bulaxaar village, in the Berbera district, the storm hit in the morning of 19 May, and a number of affected people were evacuated to higher ground, but an unknown number of people has been reported missing. Humanitarians also reported that communication with Lughaya district was disrupted when a telecommunication tower was destroyed by the storm. Authorities and humanitarians will continue to monitor the situation. As of 18 May, more than 1.3 million in Awdal, Sanaag, Togdheer and Woqooyi Galbeed were estimated to be at risk of the tropical storm, according to the WFP-led Automated Disaster Analysis and Mapping (ADAM). Similar events in Somalia, the most recent being in Puntland in late 2013, have resulted in the loss of lives, crops and livestock and the destruction of property and infrastructure.",

The Venezuelan popula#on, mainly residing in urban se1ngs, is moving towards the interior of the country due to the limited economic opportuni#es in Panama City, and the high cost of living. A considerable percentage of cases contacted during the protec#on monitoring reported that they have changed their residence to the Province of Panam\u00e1 Oeste, Province of Herrera and Province of Veraguas, which are mainly rural se1ngs.\n\nA report published by the Organiza#on of American States (OAS) noted Costa Rica\u00b4s efforts to maintain an open border policy for Venezuelans, such as accep#ng expired passports. The report1 also highlights that Venezuelans who arrived in Costa Rica during the last five years face greater vulnerability than those who arrived between 2010 and 2014. To produce the report, experts visited the country and met with various groups to understand their situa#on in Costa Rica, confirming that most venezuelans flee from widespread violence, disrup#on of public order, and viola#on of human rights. The report states it is essen#al to create the bases for a regional consensus that grants refugee status to Venezuelans according to the Cartagena Declara#on, as expressed by the OAS working group for this topic in a June 2019 regional report. The report also calls to speed up crea#on of a complementary protec#on pathway and encourages foreign donors to provide assistance \u2013 be it financial or technical.\n\nIn January 2020 UNHCR Costa Rica announced that refugees and asylum seekers could request medical insurance at their main offices. This insurance program is being founded by UNHCR (La Naci\u00f3n, 2020).\n\nIn Mexico, January started with a total of 52,982 permanent and temporary residents, students and humanitarian visa holders (as of 31st December 2019) and 18,501 Asylum applicants2. Partners in MX informed that obtaining accurate figures of Venezuelans applying for asylum in Mexican airports remains a challenge.\n\nIn Panama with the aim of reducing the risks of Gender-based violence (GBV) among refugees, asylum seekers and vulnerable migrants, partners organized a community-based ac#vity for providing informa#on regarding preven#on and response to GBV. A total of 17 Venezuelan women had ac#vely par#cipated in this event. Furthermore, to con#nue suppor#ng access to asylum in Panama, one of the partners provided legal orienta#on at the premises of the Na#onal Refugees Office (ONPAR). A total of 15 Venezuelans (10 women and 5 men) were provided with legal orienta#on.\n\nDuring the repor#ng period, a R4V partner in Panama through the Employment Centre, provided access to computers and laptops for refugees and migrants to write resumes, for ensuring access to employment web plaKorms and access to different courses through Coursera plaKorm. On January 24 Venezuelan (13 women and 11 men) had access to this service.\n\nIn addi#on, Cash-based interven#on con#nues in Panama, as one of the partners delivered mul#purpose cash for educa#onal inclusion and medical aLen#on to 168 people (90 women and 78 men). In the provinces of Panama and Panama Oeste, one of the partners provided 32 Food Coupons, reaching 86 beneficiaries (33 women, 27 men, and 26 children), allowing the beneficiaries to\n\nFull report is available in OAS webpage hLps://www.oas.org/documents/spa/press/informe-migrantes-venezolanos-en-Costa-Rica.pdf\n\nIns#tuto Nacional de Migraci\u00f3n/Direcci\u00f3n General de Regulaci\u00f3n y Archivo Migratorio (2020), \"Flujo migratorio de nacionales de Venezuela\", con datos del Sistema\n\nde Integraci\u00f3n y Procesamiento de Informaci\u00f3n Migratoria (SIPIM), con base en los registros administra#vos del Sistema Integral de Operaci\u00f3n Migratoria (SIOM).

A total of 300,000 doses were delivered throughout the country with designated hospitals starting vaccinations on March 16th. As of March 31st, 41,329 doses were administered in South Central areas, Puntland, and Somaliland. \u2022 There were 11,888 children (6,735 girls and 5,153 boys) with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) who were treated through UNICEF supported emergency nutrition services. \u2022 Nine schools in Belet Weyne had repairs and other improvements done to existing water systems by adding water connections with provision of plastic water tanks. \u2022 UNICEF supported 18,078 children (8,777 girls) with school supplies in Galgaduud, Hiraan and Middle Shabelle regions. \u2022 In C4D there were two streams of intervention, one for mass awareness on the prevention of COVID-19 infection and fatalities and another for promotion of the COVID-19 vaccine, which were in full scale operation throughout the month. \u2022 There were 6817 people (27 per cent girls) whom received mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services, psychosocial first aid, play therapy, peer to peer support, and online counselling.\n\nUNICEF\u2019s Response and Funding Status\n\nUNICEF Appeal 2021 US$ 124 million\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nFunding Overview and Partnerships In 2021, UNICEF is appealing for US$ 124.3 million to sustain provision of life-saving services including critical nutrition, health, WASH, child protection and education in emergency interventions. Continued predictable, flexible and timely donor support is critical to sustaining vital response activities and preventing further deterioration of the situation in Somalia. Funds and supplies which were carried over from 2020 have supported the results achieved so far in 2021. UNICEF humanitarian programmes also benefit from resilience funding generously contributed by multiple different donors. Such resources help UNICEF contribute towards both humanitarian efforts and interventions at the nexus between humanitarian and development action for children.\n\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Needs The impact of delayed and erratic rains in the Deyr season is becoming more apparent with water shortages and displacements continued to be reported in many communities, with increases in water prices being observed. There were over 116,000 Somalis were displaced by water shortages between October 2020 and March 2021. According to the FAO latest update, the worst affected regions include Lower Juba, Middle Juba, Gedo, Mudug, Nuugal, Bari, Toghdheer and Sool which are currently experiencing severe water shortages. By the end of March, a 200-litre barrel of water sold between USD$7 to $9, up from an average of $3 in February 2021. As of 23 March, the cumulative total number of suspected cholera cases in 2021 was 780, including 2 associated deaths with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.3 per cent1.\n\nThrough at least mid-2021 it is expected that the desert locust plague will continue to put at risk pasture and crops across the country. According to FAO, the Desert Locust upsurge showed signs of decline in March within Somalia and neighbouring countries due to ongoing control operations and poor rainfall2.\n\nMarch saw a continued uptake in the number of cases of COVID-19 within Somalia. As of the end of the month there was a total of 11,504 positive cases with 537 deaths3. The cumulative positivity rate since the start of the outbreak has declined gradually and now stands at 7.4 per cent, with a cumulative case fatality rate at 4.8 per cent4.\n\nSummary Analysis of Programme Response\n\nThe delivery of lifesaving nutrition treatment to children affected by severe acute malnutrition (SAM) has continued to be a priority for UNICEF and partners. In March, 11,888 children (6,735 girls and 5,153 boys) with SAM were treated through UNICEF supported emergency nutrition services. This is against the backdrop of the FSNAU post Deyr nutrition and food security assessment which registered a reduction the global acute malnutrition prevalence at 11.5 per cent compared to 13.8 per cent reported in the same season in 20205. It is also the lowest GAM registered in over 10 years in Somalia. Hence, UNICEF will continue to advocate for and mobilize resources to ensure that no child with SAM is left behind, prioritizing those living in marginalized and hard-to-reach communities including the internally displaced persons. The SAM admissions reported in March bring the total of admissions since the beginning of 2021 to 43,655 (24,050 girls, 19,605 boys), representing 36 per cent of the targeted UNICEF caseload for 2021. Nutrition services continue to meet the recommended standards with proportion of children cured out of children discharged at 93 per",

The national average stands at LBP 111,457 in December 2020. Beirut and El Nabatieh governorates recorded the most expensive SMEB in December 2020.\n\n\u2022 The Consumer Price Index (CPI) witnessed an annual inflation of 133% between October 2019 and November 2020, while Food Price Index (FPI) registered an inflation of 423% \u2013 representing an all-time high since CAS started price monitoring on a monthly basis in 2007.\n\n\u2022 The monthly average informal exchange rate remained stable at around USD/LBP 8,000 between September 2020 and December 2020. However, a high daily volatility was registered over the past three months, tied directly to the political developments. This is double the rate applied by banks for withdrawals in LBP from dollar denominated accounts (LBP3,900/USD)\n\n\u2022 Between January and September 2020, total imports volume decreased by 38 percent compared to the same period in 2019, while total food imports volume (excluding cereals) decreased by 18 percent. The volume of imported cereals slightly increased, at an approximate total of 1 million tons during the reporting period.\n\n\u2022 Despite a challenging market environment, local commercial supply chains continue to be able to operate efficiently. However, markets face the possibility of collapse due to increasing risks tied to the removal of subsidies and the LBP banknote liquidity crisis.\n\n\u2022 Modifications to the current subsidization mechanism are expected soon. The Central Bank expects to be able to continue the current mechanism for two additional months only. These modifications will likely lead to a further increase in prices for food and essential goods.\n\n\u2022 In 2020, an independent group of technical experts from the humanitarian community in Lebanon analysed the minimum and survival expenditure baskets and subsequently recommended a revised composition of the food and non-food items of the baskets to cover the actual consumption patterns of Syrian Refugees. As of 1st of January 2021,\n\nWFP Lebanon will be monitoring and reporting on the \u201cnew\u201d Food Basket, which stands at LBP 129,605 in December\n\nMacroeconomic Overview\n\nFor the past year, Lebanon has faced an unprecedented situation. A series of multiple and consecutive shocks has worsened the country\u2019s socio-economic, political, and health situation. An ongoing political vacuum has further worsened the situation, jeopardizing the country\u2019s chances of accessing much needed financial assistance. A highly volatile currency, closely tied to the political developments, further fuelled inflation. The\n\nGross-Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to contract by up to 25 percent by the end of 2020i. This in turn\n\nseverely hampers the ability of both Lebanese and refugee population to access basic goods and services.\n\nThe CPI witnessed an annual inflation of 133% between October 2019 and November 2020ii, while Food\n\nPrice Index (FPI) registered an inflation of 423% \u2013 representing an all-time high since CAS started price monitoring on a monthly basis in 2007. An expected removal/modification of the current subsidization mechanism scheme is in turn expected to potentially further fuel inflation trends. This confirms the strains that households are facing as a result of the economic crisis.\n\nFood Prices (SMEBiii)\n\nThe (national) average cost of the food Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB) registered an increase of 183 percent between October 2019 \u2013 the baseline month, prior to the multiple socio-economic shocks affecting the country \u2013 and December 2020. In terms of monthly variation (m-o-m), the cost of the food SMEB stabilized in December 2020 at LBP 111,457, a 2.4 percent increase from November 2020. Since the end of September 2020, the cost of the food SMEB has been fluctuating between LBP 105,000 and LBP 111,500. This follows the developments of the informal exchange rate, which witnessed a high volatility during the past three months, however remained nearly stable when comparing the monthly average rates (see exchange rate section).",

With many outbreaks recorded and controlled in the past years, one of the key strategies employed has been timely coordination of response for effective management. This has been possible through establishment of Emergency Operations Centre at the national level. In 2017, a national Public Health Emergency Operation Centre (PHEOC) was established as the NCDC Incident Coordination Centre (ICC) to serve as the national public health intelligence and response coordination hub. Using the principle of the incident management system, the ICC is being operatiionalised to monitor signals and coordinate outbreak response.\n\nAside the national ICC, the NCDC has also supported all the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory in Nigeria to establish and support state-level PHEOCs. We are proud of our state colleagues as they continue to leverage these structures to respond to and control public health emergencies in a timely and coordinated manner. The usefulness of these structures in the overall national and state-wide response to the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak cannot be over-emphasised.\n\nIn addition, the NCDC has continued to explore diverse opportunities and strategies to build the capacity of the critical mass of the national and sub-national frontline public health workforce. One of these is the public health emergency management (PHEM) basic level (BL) 3 programme recently established through partnership between the NCDC and US-Centres for Diseases Control and Prevention (US-CDC). This is the third in the series of tiered basic PHEM courses. The BL3 PHEM course is usually undertaken upon completion of online BL1 and BL2\n\nIn line with the above, the NCDC and US-CDC from 7th -12th June, 2021 conducted a Cohort 2 PHEM training for public health workforce drawn from State Ministries of Health from South-South and South East regions as well as from Port Health Services of the Federal Ministry of Health. The overall objective of the training was to strengthen the capacity of both national and sub-national frontline responders on PHEM according to minimum common standards and global best practices.\n\nKey outputs from the training were trained public health workforce with mastery of the PHEOC terminologies; appropriate application of the seven-step decision making process; PHEOC modes of operation; basic response management principles, etc.\n\nExpansion and capacity building of the country\u2019s public health workforce is an important aspect of disease preparedness activities. Hence, this training has provided additional pool of experts in the area of PHEM.\n\nThe NCDC remains committed to supporting capacity building of the national and states\u2019 workforce for an effective coordination of outbreak preparedness and response for national health security.\n\nIssue: Volume 12 No. 21. 15th June 2021\n\nOngoing incidents are defined as confirmed cases where a national EOC or equivalent has been activated (EOC is currently activated for COVID-19)\n\nOther incidents are those with confirmed cases for which EOC is not activated\n\nData Source: SITAware\n\nIssue: Volume 12 No. 21. 15th June 2021 Week 21: 24th \u2013 30th May, 2021 Note: Coronavirus Disease is from outbreak onset till week 23, 2021: 13th June, 2021)\n\nTimeliness Completeness 1.

With the new visa policy, Venezuelans are required to apply for a visa in the Dominican Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela. The visa processing seems to be taking approximately 20-25 days with visa costs amounting to US$ 250. The visa policy has increased the risks of exposure to exploitation and abuse, including smuggling, as Venezuelans seeking safety may resort to irregular means of entry and take on additional debts to pay for increased travel costs. \u2022 Community events were carried out in January with Venezuelans to validate the results of participatory assessments in five provinces (La Romana, Santo Domingo, Santiago, San Crist\u00f3bal, and B\u00e1varo) in September and October 2019. A total of 140 Venezuelan refugees and migrants participated in the exercise. Venezuelans highlighted that their main concern in the Dominican Republic is the regularization of their status. Other needs include access to the formal labor market, banking services, specialized medical care, and livelihoods. Participants also highlighted key capacities among the Venezuelan community, including strong educational and professional backgrounds, and solid community networks.\n\n\u2022 Over 145 of the most vulnerable refugees and migrants from Venezuela benefited from coordinated protection activities in January, including legal assistance, and provision of legal \u2022 Efforts were undertaken to build the capacity of authorities in regard to child protection. Partners in collaboration with the Attorney General\u2019s Office (AGO) organized workshops for 439 participants, including AGO authorities and community leaders, to strengthen coordination mechanisms related to the protection of children. \u2022 Partners are working to support the engagement of Venezuelans in communicating and finding solutions to their situations, and to strenghten community-based protection structures. A workshop on communication tools and\n\nstrategies was organized for 13 Venezuelan community leaders from four different provinces, covering topics related to advocacy, communication with communities, and social campaigns. Additional workshops on communication will be held in the coming months. \u2022 Partners also organized integration activities to foster social cohesion and promote peaceful coexistence between Venezuelan and receiving communities. These included the joint celebration of the Three Kings Day (D\u00eda de Reyes) on 6 January in Santo Domingo, and the organization of a social media campaign to increase awareness on the plight of Venezuelan refugees and migrants in the Dominican Republic and Latin America.\n\n\u00b9 This report covers the situation in the DR before the COVID-19 pandemic. * Estimated population by end of 2020 | ** From 01/01/2020 | *** Source: FTS Website\n\nOperational Overview - Who does What and Where\n\nActivities by Sector\n\nFor more information, please contact: Miriam Aertker, Senior Field Coordinator- aertker@unhcr.org | Catalina Acevedo \u2013 cacevedo@iom.int More information available on R4V.info",

    "text": "4794\n\n14 - 20 July 2018\n\nUNHCR FLASH UPDATE\n\nIn coordination with local authorities and members of the Mixed Migration Working Group, UNHCR and its partners are following-up on the situation of the refugees and migrants who were found in an abandoned truck near the outskirts of Zwara (115 km west of Tripoli). On 16 July, 98 refugees and migrants were found locked inside a sealed cargo container together with some canisters of gasoline. When identified by the authorities, 11 of the individuals had passed away (six of them were children), while others, in a critical condition, were brought to hospitals in the area. Reportedly, the truck was underway to an embarkation site west of Zwara, from where the individuals would have attempted to cross the Mediterranean Sea. In order to avoid a checkpoint, the driver allegedly abandoned the truck, leaving the trapped migrants and refugees in the sealed container. UNHCR remains concerned that men, women and children continue to risk their lives by taking dangerous routes towards Europe, many of them perishing at sea in proportionally larger numbers. Already in 2018, the bleak milestone of dead and missing at sea has reached over 1,000 for the fifth year in a row. In June alone, one person died for every seven who crossed the Central Mediterranean.\n\nPopulation Movements\n\nSo far in 2018, the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG) rescued/intercepted more than 11,800 refugees and migrants at sea during some 80 operations. Since 1 June, the number of operations increased when compared to the previous months, with over 4,840 refugees and migrants disembarked in Libya (3,453 individuals disembarked in June and 1,392 individuals disembarked so far in July). On 16 July, 158 refugees and migrants (including 34 women and nine children) were disembarked in Al Khoms. Through its partner the International Medical Corps (IMC), UNHCR provided medical assistance and non-food items at the disembarkation point.\n\nUNHCR Response\n\nOn 12 July, UNHCR visited displaced communities (IDPs) in Zintan (180 km southeast of Tripoli), located in the Nafusa Mountains. UNHCR met with local authorities and displaced families to discuss protection needs. Moving forward, in coordination with local authorities, UNHCR will provide humanitarian assistance to the community in the form of non-food items and will also implement quick impact projects (QIPs) that will benefit both the hosting community and IDPs. So far in 2018, UNHCR implemented 75 QIPs and distributed non-food items to over 31,000 IDPs and returnees. UNHCR also provided cash-based interventions to 12,686\n\nUNHCR continues to identify vulnerable refugees in Libya and seeks durable solutions for them. Since 1 September 2017, 565 individuals have been submitted for resettlement to 7 resettlement States (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland). A total of 44 individuals have departed on resettlement directly from Libya to Canada, France, Sweden and the Netherlands. A total of 541 individuals have been submitted for resettlement and are pending interview or decision by a resettlement State in Libya.\n\nSpecial thanks to our donors: Australia | Denmark | European Union | Germany | Italy | Japan | The Netherlands | Norway | Sweden | Switzerland | United Kingdom\n\nKey Figures people of concern 54,100 registered refugees & asylum-seekers 179,400* internally displaced persons 372,022* IDP returnees\n\nUNHCR Coordinated Sectors\n\nShelter & NFI Sector Cash & Markets Working Group (Co-led by UNHCR & IOM)\n\nKey Achievements in 2018\n\n24,349 medical consultations ( 35,091 in 2017) 48,375 IDPs and refugees received non-food items (113,605 in 2017) 75 Quick Impact Projects implemented in 2018\n\n3,260 IDP and refugee households received cash assistance (3,314 in 2017)\n\n17,701 individuals registered since 2016 (9,540 in 2018)\n\n8,371 rescue kits and 1,182 medical consultations provided at disembarkation points (5,327 and 2,956 in 2017)\n\n761 monitoring visits to detention centres (1,080 in 2017)",

    "text": "51595\n\nAFGHANISTAN Seasonal Monitor March 4, 2021 Below-normal precipitation and snow water volumes persist despite mid-February precipitation\n\nKEY MESSAGES \u2022 Well-distributed precipitation was observed across Figure 1. October 1, 2020 - February 28, 2021 percent of normal (1981-2010) precipitation accumulation northeastern, northern, central, and eastern parts of the country during the latter half of February. This partially eased the dry conditions prevalent since January. However, as of February 28, significant below- normal cumulative precipitation conditions persisted across the country. \u2022 As of March 2, snow depths at higher elevations continue to be well below normal. As a result of precipitation during the second half of February, some positive snow depth anomalies are observed in localized central and northeastern parts of the country. Snow water volumes continue to be below normal across the country as of March 2. However, some Source: USGS/UCSB marginal improvement in snow water volume levels is seen in northern, northeastern, and central basins due Figure 2. Snow depth difference anomaly relative to the average of 2002-2016 in mm as of March 2, 2019 to precipitation received during the second half of Late-February precipitation and anticipated precipitation through mid-March is likely to facilitate spring wheat cultivation in areas that received sufficient precipitation since mid-February. However, lack of normal snowpack development during winter and current record minimum snow water volumes across various basins may adversely affect crop development. Above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation are expected from March to May 2021 due to the prevailing La Ni\u00f1a conditions. Given expectations for below-average snowpack development, the risk of flooding and landslides during Source: USGS/NASA spring months is expected to be lower than usual. However, localized flooding is still possible due to storms.\n\nFEWS NET Afghanistan\n\nFEWS NET is a USAID-funded activity. The content of this report does not necessarily reflect the view of the United States Agency for International Development or the United States Government.\n\nAFGHANISTAN Seasonal Monitor\n\nMarch 4, 2021\n\nUPDATE ON SEASONAL PROGRESS Precipitation anomalies:\n\nCumulative precipitation from October 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021, has been below average across most of the country (Figure 1). Recently, steady precipitation in parts of the central, northern, and northeastern regions since mid-February partially eased dry conditions prevalent since January and provided sufficient moisture conditions for timely planting of spring wheat. However, cumulative precipitation deficits continue to worsen in the eastern, southeastern, southern, and southwestern parts of the country. As of February 28, average cumulative precipitation by province was below 50 percent of normal in Farah, Nimroz, Helmand, Kandahar, Zabul, Paktika, Nuristan, Nangarhar, Laghman, Nuristan, and Jawzjan.\n\nSnow depth and snow water volume:\n\nAs of March 2, positive snow depth anomalies are observed in some lower and medium elevation areas of central, northern, and northeastern regions. (Figure 2). Similarly, noticeable improvements in snow water volumes (SWV) have been observed in northern parts of the country. On the other hand, snow water volume levels remain at record minimum levels in southern\n\nand southwestern parts of the country\n\nFigure 3 highlights the SWV comparisons of 2019/20 and 2020/21 in Arghandab, Hari Rod, Kabul, and Kunduz basins as of\n\nMarch 1. At the same time of the 2019/20 season, SWV in Arghandab basin was normal, while it is currently at record minimum levels; SWV in Kabul basin was around 60 percent of normal in 2020 while it is currently at record minimum levels; SWV in Hari Rod basin was around 75 percent of normal in 2020 while it is currently slightly less than 50 percent of normal;\n\nSWV levels in Kunduz basin are at near record minimum levels in both 2020 and currently (Figure 3).",

Excluding South Africa, reported new cases and deaths decreased by 16% and 17%, respectively.\n\nHowever, the case fatality rate has been increasing in Africa and is currently at 2.6% as of 7 February, higher than the global average of 2.2%. The reported number of tests performed also fell by 24% across the continent\n\nFor more information on the disease situation, PHSM implementation and adherence in Africa, as well as PERC survey findings, please visit the PERC website.\n\nReported new cases decreased by a total of 54% across the Southern region. However, the 7-day average of reported new cases\u2014although decreasing slightly\u2014still remains high in Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia. \u25cb In Zimbabwe, although reported new cases have appeared to peak, local Zimbabwean news outlet The Standard reported that many were dying outside of hospitals accessing treatment. Shortage of beds and oxygen supplies have been cited as persistent challenges.\n\nThe total number of reported new cases also decreased in the Northern (16%) and Western (13%) regions. However, reported new cases increased in a number of Member States in the Western region, including in Benin, Guinea-Bissau, Gambia and Senegal. In Senegal, the 7-day average of reported new cases is at the highest reported yet, and continues to climb. Recently, Senegal reported that it detected the 501Y.V1 variant.\n\nThe total number of reported new cases decreased by less than 1% in the Eastern region, and increased in the Central region by 20%. In the Eastern region, reported new cases increased in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and South Sudan (and slightly in Mauritius and Djibouti). In the Central region, reported new cases increased in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo Republic, Gabon, and Sao Tome and Principe.\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL MEASURE (PHSM) HIGHLIGHTS\n\nFigure 2.

    "text": "11855\n\nThis report is produced by OCHA Libya in collaboration with humanitarian partners.\n\nHeavy impact on the civilian population, as sustained fighting continues in and around Tripoli. Displacement is now at the highest level since the crisis started\n\nUNHCR transferred vulnerable migrants and refugees from Abusliem detention centre in the conflict area. The humanitarian community maintains efforts to ensure safe passage for civilians and medical supplies and services\n\nSituation Overview\n\nArmed clashes, heavy artillery and airstrikes continued in multiple locations, including residential areas, in and around Tripoli. On 16 April late night shelling in various neighbourhoods of Tripoli, including Abusliem, Souq Jumaa and Hadbaa among others, killed six people, including four women, and wounded about 20, according to reliable but as yet unconfirmed sources.\n\nIf confirmed the number of civilian casualties verified since the start of hostilities is 80, including 20 killed.\n\nThe current reporting period marked the highest single-day increase in displacement, with more than 4,500 people newly displaced, bringing the total of IDPs to 25,000. Many civilians trapped in conflict areas face a dilemma of not knowing whether to remain in their homes or leave because of the uncertainty of clashes and shelling. This dilemma is further exacerbated because the supply of food and other essentials is running low in some neighborhoods.\n\nThe current conflict is set against a backdrop of vulnerability due to several years of conflict, socio-economic crisis and deficiencies in public services which has already left at least 820,000 people, including some 250,000 children, in dire need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE\n\nOn 16 April UNHCR with the support of International Medical Corps transferred 150 individuals from the Abusliem detention center to the UNHCR Gathering and Departure Facility (GDF) in the centre of Tripoli. Abusliem, is one of the detention centers along with Qasr Bin Ghasheer, Al Sabaa and Tajoura centres, identified by UNHCR as being in dangerous proximity to hostilities. UNHCR will continue with transfers from Abusliem as soon as security conditions allow. More than 2,700 refugees and migrants remain detained and trapped in conflict areas. Some of these were rescued and intercepted at sea and returned to Libya in recent months.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF SECTOR RESPONSE TO DATE Food Security\n\nWFP and other humanitarian partners have provided food assistance to some 4,150 people in collective shelters and in urban settings since the onset of the crisis. Food security in some detention remains a concern with access decreasing rapidly.\n\nTo date, child protection partners reached about 700 children with psycho-social support, recreational activities, and specialized psycho-social services in five IDP shelters and urban settings. DRC ensures regular protection monitoring in IDP locations in Tripoli. The humanitarian community maintains efforts to ensure safe passage for civilians and medical supplies and services. On 16 April UNHCR with the support of International Medical Corps transferred 150 individuals from the Abu Sliem detention center to the UNHCR Gathering and Departure Facility (GDF) in the centre of Tripoli.\n\nShelter and NFIs\n\nThe Shelter and NFI sector partners assisted about 1,050 families with NFI packages since the start of the clashes. The sector is ready to assist additional 6,000 families (approximately 30,000 people) using prepositioned supplies available in different locations in Tripoli.\n\nThe Health Sector partners have deployed Emergency Medical Teams and medical personnel to support hospitals, including in Tarhouna and Gharyan among others. Mobile Medical Teams provided primary health services to displaced people in collective shelters.\n\nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene\n\nSince the start of the clashes, WASH sector partners assisted 770 families, approximately 3,850 people (out of which 1,540 children) with hygiene kits. They also continue to advocate for provision of safe drinking water through water trucking, rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and provision of additional water and sanitation facilities.",

    "text": "28884\n\n********* [PAGE 1 START] *********\n\nGIEWS Country Brief\n\nReference Date: 13-May-2020\n\nInsecurity and expensive agricultural inputs continue to limit crop production\n\nHarvesting of the 2020 winter barley is almost complete, while wheat harvesting started in early May. Remote sensing analysis indicated favourable crop development with good rains throughout the season. However, continued military operations, particularly around Tripoli, have had a negative impact on agricultural activities.\n\nEnvironmental constraints limit the development of agriculture in the country. About 1.8 million hectares (out of 15.4 million) are arable, out of which 300 000 hectares are covered by permanent crops, mostly fruit and olive trees. The area suitable for irrigation is about 470 000 hectares, but only some 240 000 hectares are currently irrigated due to concerns over the depletion of underground water. Cereals are cultivated in the coastal regions, where rainfed production or cropping with supplementary irrigation is possible, and in the arid southern areas under full irrigation. The most commonly grown vegetables are tomatoes, peppers, onions and leafy greens.\n\nAlthough agriculture contributed less than 3 percent to the Gross Domestic Production (GDP) in 2011 (last information available), over one-fifth of the population is engaged in a variety of agricultural activities, often producing crops only for household consumption. Farmers report that power cuts, insecurity as well as expensive seeds, water, fuel, tools and machinery limit their capacity to produce. Sheep and goats dominate livestock production, mostly in the interior of the country. Livestock producers complain about the lack of veterinary services, vaccines and medicine as well as the high costs of feed and\n\nBelow-average crop forecast in 2020\n\nCereal crop production in 2020 is forecast at 209 000 tonnes, about 5 percent less than in the previous year, but about 12 percent below the average. The country relies heavily on\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nimports (up to 90 percent) to cover its cereal consumption requirements, mostly wheat and barley, therefore, changes in the domestic cereal production have very little impact on the import requirement. In the 2019/20 marketing year (July/June), the actual import requirement is projected at 3.2 million tonnes, about the same as in the previous year.\n\nLow oil prices, political instability and pandemic affecting economy\n\nThe GDP growth in the country is dependent on changes in oil and gas output. In 2020, the GDP is forecast to contract by 12 percent, driven by low global oil prices and internal fights over oil between governing parties. In the first three months of 2020, the country produced about 120 000 barrels of oil per day, down from 1.06 million barrels of oil per day in the first eight months of\n\nMost Libyans are employed in the public sector where salaries have not been paid for months. Government workers in eastern part of the country received their 2020 wages for the first time at the end of March 2020.\n\nAccording to the Libya Joint Market Monitoring Initiative, in the first week of April 2020 (latest information available), the cost of the Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) increased on average by almost 30 percent, driven mostly by increases in cooking fuel. The largest price increases were reported in the south where Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders are available only on the parallel market. Some markets reported shortages of food supplies, such as eggs, vegetables and wheat products. The median price for wheat flour increased by 50 percent. The Ministry of Economy has indicated that the country has sufficient stocks of wheat flour for three months.\n\nThe increases were due to stockpiling of food due to COVID-19, depreciation of Libyan Dinar on the parallel exchange rate between December 2019 and April 2020, and the decision of the Central Bank of Libya to halt foreign currency transactions in March 2020, thus limiting the flow of goods to the country. Officially USD 1 sells for LYD 1 412, while on the parallel market USD 1 sells for LYD 4 950.",

This development came after interventions by the UN, advocating for safe passage of civilians from conflict-affected areas. Through this humanitarian corridor, first responder teams also assisted people who decided to remain in the affected areas to protect their assets. Nearly 27,000 individuals have been displaced since the start of the conflict per DTM-IOM data. Push factors driving people to leave the affected areas include fighting, shelling, airstrikes as well as the lack of key services and goods such as electricity and water. On 18 April the humanitarian community launched a Flash Appeal to assist some 100,000 people including refugees and migrants affected by the conflict and in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance and protection. Humanitarian partners The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map appeal for US$10.2 million to respond in a timely and effective do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations. The Emergency Relief Coordinator allocated US$2 million from the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to respond to the current emergency and ensure civilians receive timely life-saving assistance.\n\npeople internally displaced by ongoing\n\ncivilian casualties confirmed, including 18 civilian deaths\n\npeople assisted with some form of humanitarian assistance since onset of\n\nremaining funding required for the Libya Humanitarian Response Plan 2019\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nHumanitarian corridor for civilians trapped in conflict areas: An agreement between parties to the conflict was reached on 17 April to allow families to evacuate from conflict-affected areas in the south west Tripoli. Families in Khalat al Furjan and Ain Zara were able to leave accompanied by three evacuation teams. Road blockages were removed for a period of time for the families to move. While the total number is still unconfirmed, evacuation teams report that most of the families who wanted to leave were able to do so. Evacuation teams also assisted people who decided to remain in the affected areas to protect their assets.\n\nThe situation continues to deteriorate for civilians in conflict-affected areas, with shortages of essential items such as food and bottled water due to widespread\n\nThe total number of people assisted has increased from previous updates due to enhanced reporting by sector partners.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nCountry Emergency Situation Report No. 12 | 2\n\nclosures of stores and markets. Shortages of medicines and fuel were also reported. According to a recent REACH assessment in five affected baladiyas, damage to the electrical grid was particularly severe in Al Aziziya and Swani bin Adam, where people reported power cuts of at least 16 hours per day and some reported 24-hour blackouts. The risk of armed clashes and shelling also prevents residents from reaching essential goods and services in safer areas. Nearly 4,000 refugees and migrants remain in detention centres in conflict areas or in the proximity of hostilities.\n\nDisplacement:. 2,550 new IDPs were identified in Garabolli, Msallata, Tajoura, Tripoli, Swani bin Adam, Siddi Assayeh and Zwara in the past 24 hours, according to IOM-DTM. In total nearly 27,000 individuals have fled their homes since the start of hostilities, with approximately 2,000 living in collective shelters set up by local authorities. Most displaced people stay with family and in private accommodation in neighborhoods and suburbs in Tripoli. Many IDP households remain in other areas of Tripoli close to the fighting, where they face continued risk of armed conflict.",

Heavy rainfall in Ghana, Togo, and Benin caused flooding and additional river flooding in northern Togo.\n\n2. Desert locusts are expected to return to parts of Somalia and Sudan over the next several weeks.\n\n3. Heavy rainfall has caused flooding in parts of Kenya and Uganda. Rainfall forecast next week is likely to maintain a high flood risk for these areas.\n\nFEWS NET is a USAID-funded activity. The content of this report does not necessarily reflect the view of the United States Agency for International Development or the United States Government. The FEWS NET weather hazards process and products include participation by FEWS NET field and home offices, NOAA-CPC, USGS, USDA, NASA, and a number of other national and regional organizations in the countries\n\nconcerned. Questions or comments about this product may be directed to Wassila.Thiaw@noaa.gov, fewsnetinfo@fews.net, or 1-301-683-3424.\n\nWeather Hazards Summary Africa Overview\n\nHeavy rainfall over Togo triggers river flooding Last week, rainfall was below average across the Sahel, parts of Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, and southern Chad (Figure 1). Meanwhile, rainfall over Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea was above-average. The rainy season has performed positively so far, with West Africa experiencing mostly widespread seasonal to above-average rainfall, though the Gulf of Guinea has recorded some small deficits (Figure 2).\n\nNext week, rainfall over Senegal, Mali, and Burkina Faso is forecast to be below-average. More seasonal rainfall is expected for Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Gulf of Guinea countries, while heavy rainfall is forecast for northwestern Cameroon, DRC, and Gabon.\n\nSouthern Africa experiences an onset of rainfall Last week, the deyr rains season began over Ethiopia. Parts of southern Sudan, South Sudan, western and southern Ethiopia, western Kenya, and Tanzania recorded light to moderate rainfall. Similarly, in southern Africa, Angola, Zambia, northern Mozambique, and Zimbabwe recorded light to moderate rainfall (Figure 1). The increased rainfall over Kenya triggered some flooding, and continued rainfall next week is likely to maintain a high flood risk.\n\nNext week, above-average rainfall is forecast for parts of southern Ethiopia, Uganda, DRC, and western Kenya. Meanwhile, South Sudan and Western Kenya are likely to receive more seasonal rainfall. Continued heavy rainfall in eastern DRC is likely to cause additional flooding and river flooding over Uganda and Kenya.\n\nFamine Early Warning Systems Network\n\nOctober 23 - 29, 2020 Figure 1: RFE 7-Day Total Rainfall (mm) Valid: October 14 - 20, 2020\n\nSource: NOAA/CPC Figure 2: ARC 90-Day Percent of Normal Rainfall (%) Valid: August 01 - October 20, 2020\n\nSource: NOAA/CPC\n\nWeather Hazards Summary Central Asia Weather Hazards\n\nLast week temperatures remained above average throughout Kazakhstan while Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan recorded below normal temperatures. Minimum temperatures fell to near freezing as far south as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Next week, temperatures are likely to be near normal for the period. Subfreezing minimum temperatures are forecast to be limited to Kazakhstan along with the higher elevations of Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.\n\nOctober 23 - 29, 2020\n\nFor the third consecutive week, mostly dry weather prevailed across Central Asia. 30-day precipitation deficits have developed across northern Kazakhstan, northeastern Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Snowfall that typically begins in the next several weeks across northeastern Afghanistan may provide relief to some short-term dryness. Precipitation is forecast across the higher elevations of Afghanistan next week.\n\nCentral America and the Caribbean Weather Hazards\n\n1. Rainfall deficits over the last 30-days have strengthened dryness and drought across much of the Dominican Republic.",

    "text": "6609\n\nCLUSTER\u00a0UPDATE\n\nSITUATION\u00a0OVERVIEW\n\nDespite the escalation of conflict in al-\n\nHudaydah not yet engulfing the city, recent months in Yemen have\n\nnevertheless exacted a brutal toll on civilians, who continue to be threatened by indiscriminate attacks,\n\nwhether near conflict frontlines or in\n\ntheir homes, at markets or while fleeing to places of safety. Ongoing conflict, cholera, risk of famine and the depreciating currency have increased\n\nthe protection needs of an already\n\nvulnerable population. In this context, ensuring protection of civilians remains paramount, as does addressing the growing protection\n\nneeds for the conflict-affected and\n\ndisplaced population of Yemen.\n\nDisplaced\u00a0child\u00a0at\u00a0Dharawan\u00a0Settlement,\u00a0Sana\u2019a.\u00a0UNHCR/M.Hamoud\n\nProtection\u00a0of\u00a0Civilians\n\nConflict in Yemen reached a peak in August 2018, with the highest number of civilian casualties reported\n\nin any month of the year. As documented by OHCHR, the governorates most affected by casualties in the first nine months of 2018 were Hudaydah (29%), Sa\u2019ada (19%) and Taizz (12%), as well as Hajjah (9%) and Amanat al Asimah (7%). According to the Protection Cluster\u2019s Civilian Impact Monitoring Project, which\n\nexpanded to nationwide coverage in August, there were more than 480 incidents of armed violence in\n\nAugust and September. Most incidents were airstrikes (41%) and shelling (41%), but landmines, IEDs and UXOs (7%), small arms fire (4%) and snipers (4%) were also significant. Women and children were estimated to comprise one-third of the civilian casualties monitored in August and September. While most incidents struck civilian homes and farms, 6% of incidents struck health, education, water, food and other\n\nprotected sites, while more than 7% struck civilians while in their vehicles.\n\nInternal\u00a0Displacement\n\nConflict on the western coast continues to be the main driver of new internal displacement in Yemen.\n\nAccording to the latest report of the Task Force on Population Movement, as of June 2018 there were 2.3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Yemen, along with some 1 million IDP returnees, with the\n\nlargest populations in Taizz, Hajjah, Amanat al Asimah, followed by Ibb, Sana\u2019a, Sa\u2019ada, al-Hudaydah and Amran. Based on emergency tracking, more than 425,000 people are estimated to have been displaced fro al Hudaydah since June, with the majority displaced within Hudaydah (33%) or to Amanat al Asimah\n\n(33%), with other significant locations of new displacement being Hajjah, Raymah and Taizz. Together with other humanitarian response partners and in coordination with the Rapid Response Mechanism, Protection\n\nCluster partners are working to identify vulnerable and persons with specific needs and follow-up with emergency protection assistance and services at humanitarian service and distribution points.\n\nVulnerability\u00a0and\u00a0Persons\u00a0with\u00a0Specific\u00a0Needs\n\nConflict, cholera, risk of famine and currency depreciation, continue to exacerbate the vulnerabilities of the population. In particular, women, children and persons with specific needs are at heightened risk from conflict and the consequent loss of heads of households, family separation and breakdown of community\n\nstructures. A recent report of UNHCR-funded protection monitoring partners found that more than 71%\n\nhouseholds contained a member with a specific need or vulnerability, and 12% of households reported a member exhibiting signs of conflict-related psychological distress or trauma related to the conflict.\n\nRECENT\u00a0DEVELOPMENTS Intense fighting continued in al-Hudaydah, particularly around the highway leading east to Sana\u2019a, as well as the road junctions to the south and east of the city. Daily clashes also resulted in heavy impact on civilians living in the districts of ad-Durayhimi and al-Tuhayat. Major incidents include the damage and civilian loss at al-Thawra Hospital and fish market in early August, two strikes hitting civilians in vehicles in August and October and damage to Bani Jaber IDP camp, all of which resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties. Risks remain for civilians caught up in areas near conflict lines, while safe routes for civilians to leave are not always available, due to airstrikes, armed clashes, landmines and unexploded ordnance. Al- Hudaydah also remains the most affected governorate in terms of damage to civilian Distribution of Civilian Impact Incidents infrastructure, upon which civilians are by Type of Armed Violence and Hub depending for survival, including hospitals, water, schools and religious sites. Meanwhile, children remain at heightened risk of injury during aerial bombardment, shelling, shooting and due to explosive remnants of war, and prevention of family separation is a priority along with women and girls, particularly female-headed households, who may be at risk of sexual harassment and violence.",

    "text": "50895\n\nSUDAN Food Security Outlook Update December 2019 Harvests improving food security, but flooding and pests raise concerns about crop yields KEY MESSAGES\n\nMany areas of Sudan are expected to face Minimal (IPC Phase 1) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) acute food insecurity between December 2019 and January 2020, as harvests improve food access for many households. However, very high staple food prices are continuing to result in above-average humanitarian assistance needs. Conflict-affected areas of South Kordofan and Jebel Marra, and parts of northern Kassala, North Darfur, and White Nile will be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) through January.\n\nBetween February and May 2020, food security is expected to deteriorate as household food stocks begin to be depleted, livestock productivity declines, and staple food prices increase seasonally. Parts of North Kordofan, central Kassala, and Red Sea State will deteriorate to Crisis (IPC Phase 3) during this period, while parts of South Kordofan and Jebel Marra will deteriorate to Emergency (IPC Phase 4) by May 2020 in the absence of humanitarian assistance.\n\nRecent field reports suggest a late end to the rainy season, flooding, waterlogging of crops, and pest infestations reduced main season crop yields, though reports indicate area planted is above normal. Staple food prices are expected to remain much higher than normal during the outlook period, and should production be lower than expected, households could exhaust their food stocks and market supply could tighten earlier than normal in mid-2020.\n\nCURRENT SITUATION\n\nThe main agricultural season is coming to a close with harvests of most cash crops complete and cereal harvests to be completed by late January 2020. Overall, reports indicate national area planted in crops in 2019 is above average and available information from the field also suggests there has been a shift in area planted from cereal crops to cash crops this year.\n\nMain season crop yields are reportedly lower than usual due to flooding, an extended rainy season, and pest infestations. This is despite a favorable start to the season that facilitated planting and early crop development. Significant waterlogging, particularly of sorghum, reportedly limited grain development and led to particularly severe impacts in flood-prone areas. In addition, mid-season dry spells in isolated areas have reportedly reduced yields.\n\nProjected food security outcomes, December 2019 to January 2020\n\nSource: FEWS NET Projected food security outcomes February to May 2020\n\nSource: FEWS NET\n\nFEWS NET classification is IPC-compatible. IPC-compatible analysis follows key IPC protocols but does not necessarily reflect the consensus of national food security partners.\n\nFEWS NET Sudan\n\nFEWS NET is a USAID-funded activity. The content of this report does not necessarily reflect the view of the United States Agency for International Development or the United States Government.\n\nSUDAN Food Security Outlook Update\n\nDecember 2019\n\nCultivation of wheat during the 2019/20 winter season is underway. Most of the area planted is in government-irrigated schemes in Al Jazeira, Halfa and Sennar states, while the remaining area is under small-scale cultivation in Northern, River Nile, White Nile, and Khartoum states. Actual area cultivated as of mid-October was estimated at 529,000 feddan which is moderately lower than usual. Key challenges for this winter\u2019s cultivation include the high cost of agricultural inputs, fuel shortages, and reduced access to agricultural\n\nFigure 1. Labor to sorghum terms-of-trade in select markets\n\nIn pastoral and agropastoral areas, livestock are returning north to their winter grazing Source: FEWS NET/FAMIS areas. The return of livestock, coupled with seasonal increases in milk production during and following the rainy season, are improving milk availability and food consumption at the household level. However, among many pastoral households, livestock ownership is low among poor households, whose main sources of income also include labor migration. As a result, improvements in food consumption due to improvements in livestock productivity may be more seasonally limited among poor households.",

All registered IDPs were situated in Kadugli, South Kordofan, whilst returnees were in both Zalingei, Central Darfur, as well as nine localities in North Darfur. There were no reports of flood-related displacement over this period. DTM registration of households affected by floods will commence during the rainy season in the third quarter of the year. DTM\u2019s flow monitoring point in Abyei, where South Sudanese are registered upon arrival into Sudan, has been closed since the Government of Sudan declared a nationwide health emergency and a near-total closure of its borders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on 16 March 2020.\n\nAs a sub-component of Mobility Tracking (for more information please see Round One), DTM\u2019s Emergency Event Tracking (EET) tool was activated to track sudden displacement and population movements, provide more frequent updates on the scale of displacement that occurs between Mobility Tracking rounds and quantify affected populations. When needed, registration activities were also used to verify figures collected through EET. From\n\nApril to June 2020, DTM teams conducted EET to monitor the following events:\n\nMap 1 Registration of IDPs and returnees and places of displacement where EET was activated, April to June 2020 1 Registration activities are conducted upon request.\n\nDTM Sudan April - June 2020\n\nINTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPs) SOUTH KORDOFAN Ongoing DTM registrations continued in Kadugli locality during this reporting period \u2013 2,085 individuals (654 households) were registered in April, 660 individuals (217 households) in May, and 441 individuals 3,186 Individuals (139 households) in June. The recent evacuation of displacement Male camps in South Sudan (namely, Ida, Agung and Faamir) have resulted in Individuals the largescale return of affected populations to northern Sudan (their country of origin). Consequently, the scarcity of available services, 36% transportation and infrastructure in areas of return have resulted in secondary displacement to Kadugli, South Kordofan. This accounts for IDP Vulnerabilities the high caseloads of IDPs registered in April 2020. Of the combined caseload, there was a much higher distribution of displaced females (64%) than males (36%), which may reflect the gendered impact of conflict on social structures and dynamics. Men tend to remain behind in the place of origin to fight whilst women leave with their children in search of safety. The predominant age categories recorded were youth between five and 17 years (42%) and adults between 18 and 59 years (34%), followed by 19 per cent of IDPs under the age of five. As seen with all registrations, far fewer individuals were over the age of 60 (5%). Additionally, 433 individuals (14%) reported significant vulnerabilities for consideration in humanitarian response planning, the most evident being those who were 285 110 28 2 either pregnant or unaccompanied minors. Unaccompanied minors Pregnant Physical disabilities Unaccompanied elders Chronic illnesses\n\nCENTRAL DARFUR\n\nIn June 2020, DTM registered 1,824 individuals (368 households) in Tamar Boll Jimail, Zalingei locality \u2013 having returned from recent displacement in the surrounding areas. Displacement had temporary occurred due to inter-communal conflict between local farmers and pastoralists in the previous month.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19\n\nWFP Sudan Country Brief June 2020\n\noutbreak, WFP transported 1,354 MT of non-food items to field locations at the request of UN agencies and NGOs. The items include non-food items for the\n\nresponse to the COVID-19 outbreak. During June, 284 MT were transported, and 198 MT stored for the humanitarian community.\n\nIn June, the WFP-managed United Nations\n\nHumanitarian Air Services (UNHAS) continued to transport light cargo within Sudan for UN agencies and NGOs to hard to reach destinations. In addition, UNHAS international air bridge (Khartoum \u2013 Addis\n\nAbaba \u2013 Khartoum) transported in June 204 passengers for 38 UN agencies, NGOs and diplomatic community through 14 flights.\n\nWFP June Market Monitor showed another increase in the national average retail price of sorghum compared to the previous month (increase of 10 percent), 219\n\npercent higher compared to last year, and 584 percent higher compared to the five-year average. This is mainly due to the diminishing supply from the\n\nlast year production, which was far below the average production of the last five years. It is expected that there will be a steady increase in the prices of sorghum at least until August. High food prices and\n\nhigh levels of food insecurity will likely continue at least until the next harvest season in October.\n\nThe movement of food across the country to deep field locations for the delivery of WFP assistance has proceeded but at slower pace in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nBuilding Resilience \u2022 WFP Sudan implements a post harvesting loss (PHL) project during the harvest season to mitigate harvest losses among smallholder farmers, improve household food security and increase income. \u2022 As part of the PHL project, after a storage period of three-four months, bags opening ceremonies took place in localities of White Nile, Kassala and Gedarif states. The ceremonies enabled farmers to witness the benefits of hermetic storage bags in preserving grain quality and compare with the result of grains stored with traditional bags. The activities are implemented under strict precautionary measures in the context of COVID-19 and provided the opportunity to communicate awareness messages on COVID-19.

A still low funding percentage towards the USD 737.6M requested in the Plan.\n\nNew entry requirements were implemented by Chile and Peru, while registration exercises took place in Trinidad and Tobago and\n\n3.2 Million Venezuelans living in Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nPage 1 of 6\n\nRegional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform > Situation Report \u2013 May/June 2019\n\nArea of Intervention 1: Direct emergency assistance Strategic outcome: Refugees and migrants are provided with life-saving goods and services.\n\nNeeds Assessments\n\nMonitoring exercises were conducted in Ecuador in partnership with the Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion (MIES). Results indicate that almost 40% of the 1,682 Venezuelan national interviewees report being in an irregular situation, while more than 37% indicated having a tourist visa or a \u201ctarjeta andina\u201d. The proportion of out-of-school children reported was of 41% of children aged between 5 to 11 and 53% of those aged 12 to 17 years.\n\nBasic Needs and Essential Services\n\nPartners have provided assistance to more than 8,000 refugees and migrants from Venezuela in Peru, Guyana, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, Argentina, Uruguay, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nTransportation assistance was provided to over 5,500 refugees and migrants from the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border to CEBAF and Tumbes, where approximately one fifth were referred to shelter support. More than 11,000 food and non- food kits were also provided in Peru.\n\nIn the area of food and nutrition, partners in the Caribbean (Guyana, Aruba, Curacao and Trinidad and Tobago) reached approximately 1,300 refugees and migrants from Venezuela with basic food and/or water. Temporary accommodation was also provided to 96 vulnerable refugees and migrants in Curacao, Dominican Republic, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. In the Southern Cone (Argentina and Uruguay), on the other hand, almost 40 refugees and migrants from Venezuela were provided with temporary accommodation and food assistance.\n\nHealth Services\n\nThe provision of emergency health services and assistance is a pressing need among Venezuelans across the region. In the Dominican Republic, 562 Venezuelans benefitted from individual medical consultations. In Guyana, 787 Venezuelans were immunized and vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), Yellow Fever and diphtheria before being granted stay permits. In Trinidad and Tobago, partners distributed 14 dignity kits to 13 Venezuelan and one Cuban woman, and 97 Venezuelans (75 women, 1 girl and 21 men) accessed sexual reproductive health services. In Panama, partners provided medicines (along with food vouchers and housing support) to 16 Venezuelan families, 73 persons received psychosocial assistance.\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\nRegional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform > Situation Report \u2013 May/June 2019\n\nOrientation and Information\n\nIn Costa Rica, information was provided regarding the possibility for migrant and refugee children to access to the national education system. Among these, partners selected 20 Venezuelan children - based on vulnerability criteria - and provided them with uniforms and school supplies. Partners also provided tutoring and academic support to primary and secondary students to help them enter the Costa Rican educational system.\n\nIn Mexico, partners launched an information campaign called \u201cConnecting Communities\u201d through social media sites. It included information on how to obtain work permits, carry out family reunification, access to basic education and revalidating academic degrees. The campaign is estimated to have reached an audience of over 90,000 persons.\n\nArea of Intervention 2: Protection Strategic outcome: Refugees and migrants enjoy rights and protection.",

    "text": "50896\n\nCOVID-19 continued to spread across Syria. As of 28 February 2021, the total COVID-19 cases confirmed by the Health Minister in government-held areas of Syria were 15,588, including 1,027 fatalities. The monthly increase in COVID-19 cases in January (2,564 cases) and February (1,540 cases) signals a downward trend compared to December 2020 (3,547 cases). Nonetheless, COVID-19 cases in January 2021 remained the second highest monthly caseload since the beginning of the pandemic. In opposition-held areas in northwest Syria, around 21,175 COVID-19 cases were reported by the end of February 2021, raising concerns for over three million residents who are reportedly in need of water and sanitation services, which are a prerequisite to control the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, the Syrian Council of Ministers approved Syria\u2019s participation in the COVAX vaccine programme and started preparing vaccine deployment plans with the World Health Organization, which target priority populations in three phases and seek to immunize initially around 4.5 million Syrians nationwide by the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThe fuel shortage crisis worsened further in Syria in early 2021, limiting Syria\u2019s access to fuel and reducing fuel supply in markets. Unilateral coercive measures on the country and the weakening of the Syrian pound are believed to be key drivers of the fuel shortage/ limited access to fuel. On 10 January 2021, the Syrian Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources announced a temporary reduction in fuel allocations by 17 percent for gasoline and 24 percent for diesel across Syria and increased the price of subsidized gasoline from SYP 450 to SYP 475 per liter. Moreover, the Central Bureau of Statistics of Syria reported an average inflation rate of 200 percent in 2020 compared to 2019, with goods inflation reaching 300 percent. The food security situation in Syria has also worsened over the past year, with 12.4 million people estimated to be food insecure in 2020. This represents an increase of 4.5 million people (57 percent) compared to 2019, including twice as many severely food insecure people (1.3 million people).\n\nTensions across northeast Syria remained high between the Self-Administration\u2019s security forces and the Government\u2019s official forces, with isolated yet regular attacks recorded in southern Al-Hasakeh, Ar-Raqqa, and Deir-ez-Zor governorates. Artillery shelling and inten-\n\nsified bombardments were reported in northwest Syria, especially around the M4 and M5 highways, resulting in the displacement of around 23,000 people in January 2021. The spate of violence is also impacting humanitarian operations and aid workers in northwest Syria. The United Nations reported an average of one humanitarian worker killed every 30 days over the last 14 months in this region of Syria. Additionally, torrential rains and strong winds during January and February caused widespread damage to IDP sites across northwest Syria. Close to 142,000 displaced people across 407 IDP sites (around a third of IDP sites in northwest Syria) were reportedly affected by the severe flooding, as well as more than 25,000 tents were either destroyed or damaged, further aggravating the difficult living conditions of IDPs in these camps.\n\n\u2022 In order to address the multi-faceted shocks faced by Syrians, WFP delivered general food assistance to approximately 4.7 million people in February 2021 across the country. Furthermore, WFP completed rehabilitation works at two bakeries in Aleppo and Dar\u2019a gover- norates, benefiting more than 90,000 people under WFP\u2019s Farm-to-Bread concept that aims to restore the bread supply chain for the benefit of food insecure populations. WFP has also provided ready-to-eat rations to more than 73,760 people in northwest Syria affect- ed by harsh winters and heavy rainfall since mid-January 2021.\n\nSources: Syrian Arab Republic: Recent Development Report No.23 | January 2021, COAR | Syria Update February 2021, UNHCR | Floods in Northwest Syria February 2021",

Amidst a deteriorating security situation, they reiterated their commitment to work better together and strengthen efforts to provide life-saving assistance to those affected by more than ten years of crisis in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, in north-east Nigeria, and to increase support to people rebuilding their lives and communities.\n\nOn his first official trip outside Europe, Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, European Commissioner for Crisis Management, joined by the Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr Edward Kallon, met with the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, H.E. Muhammadu Buhari, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hon. Sadiya Umar Farouq, and H.E. Borno State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, as well as various partners from local CSOs, international NGOs and UN agencies implementing the humanitarian response in north-east Nigeria.\n\nDuring this two-day visit, Commissioner Lenar\u010di\u010d and Mr Kallon, also met with people displaced and affected by the violence in the Borno State town of Gwoza and visited EU-funded relief projects.\n\nAnnouncing that the European Union will allocate an additional \u20ac26.5 million in humanitarian aid, Commissioner Lenar\u010di\u010d declared: \u201cI saw first-hand today the suffering that conflict has brought to people\u2019s lives and how crucial humanitarian aid is to people\u2019s survival. What matters most is that humanitarian organisations can reach all the people in need, without restrictions, including in areas under the influence of non-state armed groups. It is vital that all States and parties to armed conflicts respect their obligation to allow and facilitate the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief. It is also key to implement in parallel a comprehensive strategy in the region, exploring political tracks while addressing the root causes of conflict.\u201d\n\nRecent weeks have been marked by an upsurge in violent attacks from non-state armed groups and an increasing trend of illegal checkpoints on major supply and commercial routes directly targeting civilians, authorities and aid workers, especially in Borno State. Twelve aid workers were deliberately and brutally murdered by non-state armed groups in 2019, twice the number in 2018. Two aid workers, Grace Taku and Alice Loksha, are still being held hostage by non-state armed groups and the humanitarian community call for their immediate and safe release.\n\n\u201cThis highly symbolic visit comes at a critical time and brings together the United Nations, international and Nigerian NGOs, local and national CSOs and the European Union, as one of the most important donors,\u201d highlighted Mr Kallon. \u201cWe are extremely worried that civilians and those who are providing them with assistance are the direct target of violent attacks, hindering our ability to save lives and help people rebuild livelihoods and communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll actors and stakeholders must strengthen their efforts to provide life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people affected by the crisis, and do their utmost to guarantee the protection of civilians and aid workers, and safe, unconditional access to the people in need,\u201d added the Humanitarian\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in Nigeria remains one of the largest crises across the globe. In a complex and volatile security environment, the United Nations and NGO partners, in collaboration with local and national authorities in Nigeria, have delivered urgent support and basic services to over 5.6 million people in the crisis-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, in Nigeria\u2019s north-east.\n\nIn 2020, the humanitarian community estimates that 7.7 million people will need emergency assistance. Over 1.8 million people, across the three crisis-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe are still living in camps or are hosted in other communities, that are themselves becoming extremely vulnerable. 1.2 million people in need remain cut off from humanitarian aid in hard-to-reach areas.",

Libya reported its first COVID-19 case on March 24th. As of April 13th, there are 26 recorded cases of COVID-19 in Libya out of some 535 tests that have been conducted. Given that testing is limited, it is likely that the reported number of cases is a conservative estimate. Moreover, the escalating conflict, particularly in Tripoli and along the western coast, is impeding the country\u2019s ability to respond to COVID-19 cases. Understanding the specific needs, perceptions and experiences of people on the move in relation to COVID-19 can inform the work of humanitarian actors, particularly those in health and livelihood programming, seeking to assist refugees and migrants in Libya.\n\nThe main basis of analysis for this snapshot is 40 refugees and migrants surveyed in Tripoli between April 6th and 13th 2020. The primary nationalities of refugees and migrants surveyed was Nigerian (n=12), followed by Ghanaian (n=11), Burkinabe (n=5) and Nigerien (n=4). Other nationalities include Beninese, Ivorians, Malians, Senegalese, and Sudanese. Of those surveyed, 32 are male, and 8 are female, and their ages range from 20 to 42 years of age. The largest share of respondents noted that they had not reached the end of their journey (n=17), while 11 highlighted that they had reached the end of their journey (11 did not know if they had, and 1 respondent refused to answer).\n\nMost refugee and migrant respondents are worried about catching COVID-19\n\nWhen asked if they had heard of coronavirus, all 40 of those surveyed responded that they had, and all but one noted that they had seen people acting more cautiously through measures such as keeping distance or wearing gloves. Twenty-three respondents noted that they agreed or strongly agreed with the statemen \u201cI am worried about catching corona virus,\u201d whereas 13 respondents strongly agreed or agreed with the statement \u201cI am worried about transmitting corona virus.\u201d\n\nFigure 1. Refugees\u2019 and migrants\u2019 perceptions of coronavirus transmission\n\n\u201cI am worried about transmitting coronavirus\u201d \u201cI am worried about catching coronavirus\u201d\n\n20% 40%\n\nAll surveyed refugees and migrants are taking extra precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19\n\nAll respondents reported taking measures to protect themselves and their communities from the transmission of coronavirus. Of the 40 respondents, 38 reported washing their hands more often or using hand sanitizer. Thirty-two respondents reported wearing a mask and gloves. Moreover, a majority of respondents cited avoiding crowded spaces (n=27) and staying at home and self-isolating (n=23).\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nRefugees and migrants report a wide variety of barriers to access to healthcare in Tripoli\n\nWhen refugee and migrant respondents in Tripoli were asked \u201cIf you had coronavirus symptoms and needed healthcare, would you be able to access health services today?\u201d, just over half (n=21) said they could, 11 were unsure, 6 refused to answer, and 2 said they could not access health services. When asked about specific barriers to access, primary barriers included not knowing where to go (n=18), discrimination (n=16), and fear predicated on their migration status (n=15).\n\nFigure 2. What are the barriers to accessing health services?\n\nI don\u2019t know where to go for healthcare\n\nDiscrimination against foreigners limits access to services\n\nI am afraid of being reported to authorities, or arrest, or deportation\n\nI don\u2019t have the money to pay for health services\n\nThe advice for testing and treating coronavirus is unclear here\n\nI don\u2019t speak the language\n\nI don\u2019t have the right or the legal documentation to access health services here",

    "text": "26380\n\nThis report is produced by OCHA Libya in collaboration with WHO Libya and humanitarian partners. The next report will be issued on or around 6 April 2020.\n\n\uf0b7 As of 29 March 2020, there has been eight confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in Libya.\n\nLibya\u2019s COVID-19 Health Sector Plan has been developed, appealing for US $12.5 million, targeting key hospitals and locations in all 22 districts, in six technical areas.\n\nThe most urgent needs include isolation units, personal protective equipment, lab reagent detection kits and training of health care workers.\n\nOngoing clashes and COVID-19 prevention measures are hampering humanitarian access, free movement of medical and humanitarian personnel and medical and humanitarian assistance across the country.\n\nAs of 29 March 2020, the Libyan National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has reported eight confirmed cases of COVID- 19 reported in Libya. There is a total of 112 suspected cases, 120 cases have been tested and 125 people have been placed into quarantine. Of the confirmed cases, six have been identified in Misrata and two in Tripoli.\n\nLibya is at high risk of the spread of COVID-19 given its growing levels of insecurity, political fragmentation, weak health system and high numbers of migrants, refugees and IDPs. Libya is in its ninth year of instability and conflict. The Libyan health system was already over-stretched, under-resourced and unlikely to be able to respond to the pandemic.\n\nBoth national authorities in the West and East have implemented curfews \u2013 14:00 to 07:00 in the West and 15:00 to 07:00 in the East \u2013 in addition to other prevention measures limiting the movement between municipalities and regions. Friday\n\nprayers and gatherings at mosques have been suspended until further notice, as have all major events and gatherings. All shops have been closed, except for those selling food and pharmacies. Schools have also been closed. Restrictions of some public transportation have been imposed.\n\nAll air, land and sea borders are closed, with exemptions for certain people and services. Additional restrictions are also reportedly being put in place at the sub-national level by municipal authorities. Points of entry (PoEs) to screen travelers\n\narriving from affected areas have been established at three airports (Mitiga, Misrata and Benina), four sea ports and land border entry points at Ras Ijdier, Wazen and Msaed. Each PoE is coordinating with the NCDC\u2019s International Health Control Office on the measures to be taken to detect suspected cases.\n\nHumanitarian Impact and Access\n\nThe ongoing clashes, along with COVID-19 restriction measures, hamper humanitarian access and the free movement of medical and other humanitarian personnel, as well as humanitarian assistance across the country. For the month of March, humanitarian agencies have reported 164 access constraints related to COVID-19 (19 per cent of all reported access constraints). This was due to measures imposed by the authorities in Libya, such as curfews and limitations on movement, but also due to precautionary measures taken by humanitarian agencies to avoid transmission. For example, agencies have reported not being able to dispatch trucks to deliver assistance over long distances to the curfew conditions. Negotiations are ongoing with the relevant authorities to issue exemptions for humanitarian movements and activities so that assistance is delivered during this critical time.\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\nLIBYA COVID-19 Flash Update No. 01 | 2\n\nThis also includes humanitarian air flights, which UN agencies and INGOs rely on to move humanitarian personnel. There are ongoing efforts with relevant authorities in both the West and East to ensure that there is timely clearance of critical medical supplies, humanitarian assistance and humanitarian air flights.\n\nA number of humanitarian partners, including UN agencies, INGOs and national NGOs have reported operational delays and disruptions due to preventive measures. Many programmes, included those under the 2020 Libya Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) are either being suspended, delayed or reduced, or are being re-directed or adapted to complement activities in the COVID-19 Health Sector Response Plan. Partners are also reviewing assistance modalities to mitigate risk of transmission. For example, partners are revising how to undertake distribution of assistance, including identification of sites to channel traffic, avoid crowding and maintain social distancing, as well as ensuring staff have adequate personal protective equipment and any personnel who travelled during the past 14 days are not present at distribution points.",

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are ongoing in the post-harvest period. Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are expected to emerge in Ambovombe and Ampanihy districts in October. Madagascar was affected by consecutive droughts leading to extremely low cereal and tuber production in the 2020/21 season. The forecast for the start of the 2021/22 rainy season is being closely monitored, given concerns about a possible late start of rainfall, which would have further negative effects on agricultural labor opportunities, wild food availability, production, and prices 2022.\n\nConflict in eastern DRC and Cabo Delgado, Mozambique, continue to disrupt livelihood activities and disrupted the 2020/21 agricultural seasons. In DRC, clashes between the national army and rebel groups continue, and the number of displaced people continues to increase. This is leading to disruption of livelihoods and increased food insecurity. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes will therefore persist in Eastern DRC and Cabo Delgado through January 2022. In the rest of the region, Minimal (IPC Phase 1) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are expected to be widespread as households consume food from own production. Although, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to emerge in some deficit areas while Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes become more widespread.\n\nViolent protests erupted in South Africa, resulting in more than 200 deaths, many injuries, massive looting, burning of trucks, buildings, destruction of property and infrastructure. The unrest resulted in the sudden loss of labor opportunities and employment for many vulnerable South Africans, let alone regional migrants. Among the affected areas was the Port of Durban, which could lead to some short-term impacts on regional supply chains as most regional markets depend on this port.\n\nProjected food security outcomes, June to September 2020\n\nSource: FEWS NET Projected food security outcomes, October 2021 to January 2022\n\nSouthern Africa is at the peak of the third wave of COVID-19, with a high number of cases and deaths being experienced across the region. As of July 1, 2.5 million COVID-19 cases and 72,000 associated deaths Source: FEWS NET were reported across the region since the start of the pandemic.

Zimbabwe and Malawi are expecting a surplus, which is in part driving the above-average regional cereal supply.

In May, an oversight economic committee was established with up to 27 expert members. The oversight committee, which reports directly to STC leadership, is expected to provide supervision and guidance on economic management to government institutions in Aden. Other key responsibilities include the preparation of reform agendas to address issues with public services delivery (electricity, water, health care) and improve the overall performance and efficiency in the public sector. In addition, task teams have been formed to monitor government operating expenses, especially by economic and revenue\n\nReportedly, most revenue-collecting government institutions in Aden have deposited public revenue into the designated \u201cself-rule\u201d accounts with the Al Ahli Bank, in response to the STC\u2019s request. Major economic institutions such as the Customs, Tax Authority, Aden Refinery Company, Port of Aden, and Authority of Aden Free Zone are among those reported to have complied with the STC. It is not clear if the STC has gained oversight over oil exports, the central source of government revenue. The STC stated that the measure was intended to enhance transparency of the use of public resources, fulfill payroll obligations, and rationalize the recourse to money printing to finance the deficit, but not to overrule the existing budget framework. Public sector salary payments remain irregular in the southern governorates. While the stagnation of salary disbursements was first reported in early 2020, disruptions in revenue collection since the STC\u2019s self-rule declaration appear to have exacerbated the problem.\n\nMeanwhile in Sana\u2019a, the de facto authorities implemented a series of legislative economic reforms to improve the business environment in the controlled territory (\u201cnorth\u201d). On May 3, 2020, the de facto authorities issued Laws No. 5 to No. 8 (2020), ratifying amendments to the Custom Tariff Laws, General Sales Tax Law and Income Tax Law. The legislative revisions are part of the economic measures under the Economic Revival and Recovery Strategy 2019-20, announced in January 2020.2 The amendments provide tax exemptions to support small businesses, strengthen local production of medicine, and facilitate renewable energy investment to reduce reliance on imported fuel products. During April-May, half of January 2018 salaries were disbursed to civil servants in the north, drawing resources from the special account with the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) branch in Hodeidah.3\n\nPrepared by Naoko C. Kojo (Senior Economist) and Amir M. Althibah (Research Analyst) of the Global Practice for Macroeconomics, Trade and Investment, based on information available up to June 8, 2020.

Parallel Market Exchange Rates the Yemeni rial crossed the YR 700/US$ mark for (Daily Average, YR/US$) the first time since November 2018 in areas controlled by the Government (\u201csouth\u201d). The rial continued to depreciate moderately by about 3.7 percent per US dollar during May, compared with 1.9 percent in April, amid dwindling foreign reserves and anticipation of increased 550 monetization of the fiscal deficit (Figure 1). In early 500 June, however, the modestly declining trend 450 changed dramatically. During the first week of 400 June alone, the rial fell by more than 3 percent, 350 from YR 701/US$ to YR723/US$, possibly triggered by the unmet expectations for the donor pledging Source: Data collected from Informal exchange rate markets event held on June 2.4 Reportedly, the CBY in Aden and staff estimates. instructed exchange bureaus to suspend currency trading, accusing \u201ccurrency manipulators\u201d and \u201ccorrupt money exchangers\u201d of the depreciation of the local currency.5 The exchange rate of the rial remained stable at YR 600-602 per US dollar in the north due to the monetary measures implemented in December 2019.6 The wedge between the two parallel market exchange rates reached YR 100 or 17 percent at end-May. Going forward, downward pressure on the rial is expected to intensify given the bleak prospect for remittance inflows, especially from the neighboring countries, and the absence of external financial support (See Box).7 Demand for foreign",

A total of 11 states are affected, indicating widespread circulation of virus. \uf0b7 The cases have onset of paralysis between 07 March 2020 and 18 August 2020. \uf0b7 A total of nine environmental samples positive for cVDPV2 have been detected so far, all from Khartoum state with most recent collection on 9 August 2020. The outbreak in Sudan is related to an outbreak of cVDPV2 in the eastern part of Chad. \uf0b7 Planning is ongoing for the first round of outbreak response campaign October. The current plan is to vaccinate 8.6 million children under five twice in all 18 states of the country, using mOPV2 vaccine during October- \uf0b7 More than 826,300 people are affected by flooding across Sudan\u2019s 18 states, with at least 74,654 homes de- stroyed. This is likely to have implications on the campaign quality. Hygiene and sanitary levels have dropped due to flooded drainage systems and contaminated water supplies, raising the likelihood of disease spread. (source: OCHA, 22 September 2020)\n\nDistribution of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases, Sudan, 2020\n\nImmunization activities \uf0b7 Coordination continues between the Government, and country office, regional office and HQ levels of WHO and UNICEF in order to plan and facilitate a large scale outbreak response. \uf0b7 Phase 1 of an Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) campaign was held in the four states of Khartoum, River Nile, Northern and White Nile between 16-23 September. The targeted children were born between June 2016 to Dec 2017. Five states were not able to conduct IPV during phase 1 due to the rainy season and flood emergency in Raising routine immunization levels through vaccination with IPV is a critical part of closing the population immunity gap and providing lasting protection to children against polio. The second round of routine acceleration in 109 low performing localities (13 states) started this week.\n\nDisease surveillance\n\nSudan annualized Non-polio AFP rate is 3 per 100 000 under 15 years children: It was 3+ in 11 states, between 2 and 3 in 7 states and no states had a rate of less than 2. The stool specimens adequacy rate was 94%. The Sudan polio programme reported 59 new acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in week 37. Samples from 8 con- tacts and 25 healthy children were collected. The total number of reported AFP cases in week 37 was 393, of which 288 cases (73%) had been discarded as non-polio AFP cases, 82 cases (21%) were pending classification and 23 cases are cVDPV2 (6%). \uf0b7 A weekly supplementary report from 11 priority states has been launched. From 20 June to date, a total of 476 active surveillance visits and 146 supervisory surveillance visits have been conducted in these states. In addition, 1236 surveillance workers have been trained. Vaccine management\n\nTwo international technical surge support personnel have been deployed to Sudan to support campaign readiness and implementation. 10 million doses of mOPV2 vaccine are scheduled to arrive on the 1st October for the first round of the polio out-\n\nbreak response campaign.\n\nCommunications and C4D (Communications for Development)\n\nCoordinated Communication and Social Mobilization activities have been organized jointly between the Health Promotion Department of the Federal Ministry of Health, WHO and UNICEF. To mark the arrival of 10 million doses of polio vaccine in the country ready for the campaign, WHO and UNICEF will release a joint press release. International C4D surge staff have arrived in Sudan to provide technical support to the Polio Outbreak Technical Committee in finalizing the response budget, finalizing guidelines and operational procedures and reviewing com- munication materials and a health promoters training manual. Recruitment of social mobilizers in all 18 states is ongoing. The social mobilizers\u2019 training, which mainly aims to enhance personal communication skills and convey key messages on polio to give to caregivers and other stake- holders is planned for early October. C4D and health promotion officers across Sudan are meeting on weekly basis to enhance coordination of the so- cial mobilization activities associated with the polio outbreak response. Sudanese Red Crescent Society agreed to provide human resource to support social mobilization activities through its large volunteer network across Sudan. UNICEF, SRCS and HP will sign a memorandum of understanding to serve that purpose. Rapid Assessment data has been collected in nine states. The data was analyzed and the outcome of the assess- ment will inform the communication and social development interventions associated with the polio outbreak re-",

The most concerning incident occurred on 2 August when strikes were reported at a fish market and near Al Thawrah Hospital in Al Hudaydah City, killing civilians including women and children. As of 6 August, WHO reports that the latest casualty figures stand at 55 deaths and 130 injuries.\n\nCivilians and hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Several partners condemned the strikes and called on all parties to the conflict to respect the laws of war.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said this before and we are saying it again - parties to the conflict are obliged to do everything possible to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure. This is not a voluntary commitment - it is mandatory on all belligerents,\u201d said Ms. Lise Grande, Yemen Humanitarian Coordinator. \u201cSo many people have died in Yemen - this conflict has to stop.\u201d\n\nOngoing violence in Al Hudaydah Governorate is continuing to trigger displacement. Since June 2018, humanitarian partners in Hudaydah hub have registered more than 50,500 displaced households. While most displaced people are hosted within the Al Thawrah is one of the few functioning hospitals in Al Hudaydah City. governorate, others have moved to neighbouring Photo: OCHA governorates and need humanitarian assistance. Nine schools in Sana\u2019a City are currently hosting displaced households. In Taizz and Ibb governorates, displacement from Al Hudaydah has reached over 4,300\n\nDuring the reporting period, civilian casualties were reported in Sa\u2019ada and Al Jawf governorates, especially in districts bordering Saudi Arabia, as airstrikes, shelling and fierce fighting continued. Casualties included a child and his mother in Sagayn District and another civilian in Shada\u2019a District, Sa\u2019ada Governorate. In Al Jawf, two civilians were reportedly killed by airstrikes in Bart Al Anan District.\n\nArmed clashes intensified in the northern and eastern parts of Taizz City, with residential neighbourhoods coming under indiscriminate shelling. On 28 July, Al-Thawrah Hospital inside the city was hit but no casualties were reported. Other incidents occurred in Aden and Lahj, with casualties. One partner in Aden reported on 1 August that the local trauma hospital has received 493 patients from the frontlines on the western coast since April; 83 per cent of the 173 patients received from Al Hudaydah and Taizz in July were injured by gun shots, landmines or\n\nUPDATES FROM THE HUBS\n\nAl Hudaydah: Since June, partners in Al Hudaydah have registered 50,552 displaced households that are hosted in various governorates. Displacement\n\ncontinues from areas where military operations are ongoing. As of 5 August, partners had assisted 47,400 displaced households through the rapid response\n\nmechanism. Over 11,000 households received multi- purpose cash grants some 13,200 received NFIs and emergency shelter kits. However, airstrikes and shelling increased over the reporting period. A warehouse for a humanitarian partner was hit, damaging an estimated 8,000 hygiene kits and 51 water storage tanks of 2,000 liters capacity. Overall, airstrikes were reported in 12 districts in Al Hudaydah Governorate. There are concerns that ongoing conflict could disrupt water supply systems, compounding the risk of cholera and other diseases.\n\nAden: More than 4,800 households were displaced by conflict to Aden and other accessible areas in the southern governorates from 1 June to 1 August. Some 4,217 households have been registered and 3,119 households have received rapid response kits. During the reporting period, partners also discussed demining activities in west coast districts. Meanwhile, the depreciation of the local currency in Aden has led to increased prices of essential commodity prices. Prices have increased by more than 15-20 per cent despite the attempts of the Central Bank in Aden to close unlicensed exchange shops.",

    "text": "52593\n\nRepublic to the DRC\n\n12 March 2021\n\nL2 Emergency Declaration\n\nOn 21 January, a Level 2 emergency has been declared for the UNHCR Operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This decision is designed to scale up UNHCR operations\u2019 preparedness and response activities in addressing the protection needs of refugees and other populations affected by the new crisis.\n\nThe Central African Republic (CAR) is gearing up for the second round of legislative elections taking place on Sunday 14 March 2021. Presidential and legislative elections were held earlier on 27 December 2020 in a tense security context characterized by sporadic violence. Several armed groups, most of them, signatories of the February 2019 peace agreement, called off a ceasefire and merged into the Coalition of Patriots for Change (CPC). They resumed military operations against the government, carrying out deadly attacks in major towns including on the outskirts of the capital Bangui. There have been fears of further violence, since the validation of the victory of re-elected president, Faustin Archange Touadera by CAR\u2019s Constitutional Court on Monday 18 January 2021.\n\nSecurity situation\n\nThe Central African Republic continues to observe a state of emergency declared by authorities on 21 January, although the night curfew has been temporarily eased to facilitate voting in the upcoming legislation elections run- off. As the situation remains tense within CAR, displacement is expected to continue in the near future. The newly displaced population reported human rights violations against civilians and looting by armed groups in various villages in CAR. Most of the new arrivals remain very close to the borders where they face risks of further attacks and rights violations by armed groups. The majority of them are women and children, while there are also many persons with special needs, such as elderly persons at risk, persons with disabilities and survivors of SGBV.\n\nUNHCR and the National Commission for Refugees (CNR) joint monitoring teams at the border in the three provinces affected by the influx, report that, most of the arrivals are from the south-eastern town of B\u00e9ma. Bangassou, and most recently, Bangui. A majority of the new arrivals are staying in makeshift shelters, while others live with host families.\n\n1 | P a g e\n\nConsequences on the voluntary repatriation operation Insecurity in CAR is affecting the voluntary repatriation operation, relaunched in November 2020 after the COVID- 19 pandemic had forced border closures. More than 17,000 refugees currently living at Mole and Boyabu camps in South Ubangi Province had expressed their intention to return home. However, several areas previously deemed safe to receive returnees are now possibly controlled by rebels. It should be noted that some of the new arrivals from the outskirts of Bangui are possibly refugees who had returned in recent voluntary repatriations from Mole and Boyabu camps in South Ubangi province, between 2019 and 2020.\n\nFigure 1 : Entry points of newly arrived families from the Central African Republic\n\nAccording to local authorities, 92,053 individuals from the Central African Republic have arrived in the DRC. (this estimated figure is yet to be verified). This includes an estimated 46,659 individuals in Bas Uele Province, 35,331 in North Ubangi Province and 10,063 in South Ubangi province. Most of the new arrivals have stayed close to the borders in some 40 villages along the banks of the border rivers that separate CAR from DRC.\n\nBiometric registration of refugees is ongoing in several locations along the border. As of 11 March 2021, UNHCR and CNR have biometrically registered 48,264 individuals (13,587 households) refugees from CAR.\n\nThe greatest needs of the new arrivals regard food, water, shelter, health care, documentation, education, core relief items and sanitation to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and epidemic diseases.\n\nAn urgent vaccination drive is needed to mitigate a high risk of a major measles epidemic reported by joint health evaluation teams of UN Agencies, NGOs, and the Provincial Health Division in refugee hosting areas in North Ubangi Province. Less than 30% of refugee children under five are vaccinated. Suspected cases are already being reported among some host communities. Mobile clinics are urgently needed to reach populations in areas where there are no health services, in the three provinces affected by the new influx. There have been reports of fatalities linked to a lack of access to health care among new arrivals in Bosobolo Territory, North Ubangi Province.",

The ceasefire was implemented\n\nwith the first stages of redeployment reportedly taking initial assessment team to Hudaydah in January, with the aim to inform the scope of its role in the Red Sea\n\n*EMOP has been extended until 31 March 2019. ICSP total requirements for 2019 including the scale-up\n\nOn 26 December, as part of the agreement from the first Joint meeting of the Redeployment Coordination Committee (RCC), the opening of the Hudaydah- Sana\u2019a highway, to be used as a humanitarian corridor and scheduled to take place on 29 December, was postponed. As soon as the situation allows, a WFP truck loaded with wheat flour is to be included in the humanitarian convoy.\n\nIn response to the increased fighting in Hodeidah governorate, a Rapid Response Mechanism was established in June to accelerate the humanitarian response for newly displaced persons and to ensure their most basic needs are addressed. In particular, WFP is\n\nproviding displaced families with Immediate Response Rations (IRR) sufficient for five days, through Humanitarian Service Points and Humanitarian and Humanitarian Transit Sites. From the start of the large-scale IDP response in June until December, WFP has provided IRRs to 175,967\n\nIn addition to the Immediate Response Rations provided to displaced people fleeing violence from Hodeidah, WFP is also providing to all newly displaced people a one-off\n\nGeneral Food Assistance (GFA) ration, either in-kind or via a commodity voucher, sufficient for one month. Thus far, WFP has provided 106,518 households with a one-off GFA\n\nration - 42,053 IDP households have received in-kind general food distributions (GFD) and 64,465 households have received commodity vouchers in 14 governorates.\n\nBetween January and December 2018, WFP has admitted 478,638 children aged 6 to 59 months and 335,854\n\npregnant and lactating women (PLW) into WFP\u2019s Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programme (TSFP). For WFP\u2019s Blanket Supplementary Feeding Programme (BSFP) aimed to prevent moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), WFP admitted 305,861 children aged 6 to 23 months and 420,016 PLW.\n\nIn December, under the Enhanced Rural Resilience programme in Yemen (ERRY), 900 participants in Lahj and\n\nWFP Yemen Country Brief December 2018\n\nHajja received cash transfers for the December cycle, benefitting a total of 6,300 beneficiaries. Through WFP\u2019s Food for Assets livelihoods initiative, 4,000 people in Aden, Hajja and Sana\u2019a participated in\n\nrehabilitation activities, benefitting a total of 28,000\n\nIn December, through the school meals programme, WFP provided enough fortified date bars for 433,774 children attending schools in 10 governorates in northern Yemen, and enough high-energy biscuits (HEBs) for 56,670 schoolchildren in three governorates in southern Yemen.\n\nDue to the volatility and uncertainty of the security situation in Hudaydah, vessel movement to Hudaydah port has been significantly affected over the past two months. However, vessels carrying food and fuel, including WFP-charted vessels, are still granted access to Hudaydah and Saleef ports, with operational but with minimal capacity.\n\nSince September, WFP remains unable to access the Red Sea Mill silos in Hudaydah, due to the intense fighting in the area. The mills are currently storing 51,000 mt of WFP wheat \u2013 enough to assist 3.7 million severely food insecure people for one month. WFP continues to gather information on the status of the mills and remains on standby to access and distribute the commodities as soon as the situation permits.\n\nFunding and Pipeline update \u2022 Based on the ICSP, WFP urgently needs an additional USD 594.6 million to ensure operations can continue unimpeded over the next six months.\n\nIn order to scale up to assist up to 12 million beneficiaries a month, monthly food requirements will increase from 100,000 mt to approximately 160,000 mt, requiring USD 176 million per month. WFP requires an additional USD 1.5 billion for the rest of 2019 to meet the additional needs. WFP currently has 190,895 mt of cereals in country, sufficient to cover requirements until the third week of March 2019.",

    "text": "31897\n\nThe spread of COVID-19 in the region continues, with cases also detected among refugees and migrants from Venezuela. To date, at least 58 cases were reported, including 22 in Ecuador, 21 in Brazil, seven in Chile, two in Peru, two in Aruba, two in Colombia and two in the Dominican Republic. The situation of refugees and migrants is worsened by rising levels of xenophobia and discrimination against Venezuelans, especially those living on the streets during the pandemic, as they are accused of spreading COVID-19.\n\nThe situation of refugees and migrants who are returning to Venezuela is of grave concern to R4V partners. An increasing number of refugees and migrants are now returning to Venezuela from Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru as quarantine measures in host countries leave them without assistance nor means to provide for themselves. With borders in the region closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many now consider returning through irregular channels. The risks associated with such return movements include further exposure to the virus, enhancement of the virus\u2019 spread, as well as risks arising from irregular movements such as human trafficking and abuse at smugglers\u00b4 hands. Partners have also received reports of refugees and migrants being threatened by armed groups that prohibit transits in border areas between Colombia and\n\nThe Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP) continues to be underfunded, limiting activities of over 137 organizations for refugees and migrants from Venezuela and host communities. As of 1 May, appealing organizations have received USD 50.6 million, representing 4% of the total financial requirements of the RMRP (USD 1.35 billion). As the RMRP is under revision to include COVID-19-related activities, there is an urgent need to support appealing organizations in their response.\n\nPlatforms\u2019 Response**\n\nThe Regional Platform is finalizing the review of the RMRP 2020, with country and regional sector chapters being developed\n\nthis week. In alignment with the Global Humanitarian Response Plan \u2013 COVID-19, the RMRP review is expected to be launched next week. The document will outline new priorities and operational planning adjustments of appealing organizations in response to the continued spread of COVID-19 and its impact on refugees, migrants and affected host communities in the region.\n\nIn Colombia, the Inter-Agency Group for Mixed Migration Flows (GIFMM) worked with partners on a COVID-19 focused Rapid Needs Assessment in preparation for the review of the RMRP 2020. In addition, local coordination efforts continued in support of local authorities in delivering humanitarian assistance, such as food, hygiene kits and NFI. The GIFMM is also working to expand multipurpose cash assistance, as well as temporary shelters for vulnerable refugees, migrants and host communities. GIFMM partners are supporting local authorities in the COVID-19 response with medical teams, delivering personal protective equipment and enhancing WASH facilities.\n\nIn Brazil, the Platform and partners supported the relocation of 220 refugees and migrants in Boa Vista to shelters of the national Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Acolhida. In addition, over 600 individuals located at the bus terminal in Boa Vista were registered to receive hygiene kits distributed by R4V partners and Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Acolhida. In Manaus, partners are informing Venezuelans of the potential risk of inter-state movements during periods of lockdown enforced by the authorities, as well as about risks of irregular border crossings.\n\nIn Ecuador, the Grupo de Trabajo para Refugiados y Migrantes (GTRM) finalized the review of its country chapter of the RMRP. This week, R4V partners have observed increasing xenophobia and calls for Venezuelans to leave northern and\n\nsouthern border towns (Tulc\u00e1n and Huaquillas). Under the revised RMRP, R4V partners will in this respect prioritize\n\ninformation-sharing on health considerations as well as anti-xenophobic campaigns.\n\nIn Peru, the GTRM is supporting the identification of refugee and migrant health professionals to support the emergency response following the validation of their diplomas. In addition, partners are supporting the Ministry of Health with temporary shelters to strengthen and extend health structures. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, partners have organized cash-based interventions for over 13,000 refugees and migrants from Venezuela throughout the country.",

    "text": "61644\n\nThis report is compiled by OCHA Nigeria in collaboration with humanitarian partners.\n\nTwo cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) test positive for cholera, as partners engage the Government on a declaration of outbreak to facilitate the rapid scale-up of response. Government and partners facilitate a contingency planning workshop to mitigate the impacts of flooding across vulnerable locations as the rainy season approaches its peak. Protection partners intensify advocacy with Government on the construction of information centers in out-of-camp areas to strengthen/improve service delivery.\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nTwo cases of AWD test positive for cholera\n\nA second case of cholera was confirmed in Adamawa State during the week following laboratory tests of AWD samples by the national reference laboratory in Abuja, the country\u2019s capital. Both confirmed cases are from Girei LGA, which has six AWD cases. Yola North has one case, bringing the total to seven with no fatalities. Partners are following up with the State Government on the declaration of an outbreak to enable the scale-up of ongoing response. Across affected and vulnerable locations, humanitarian partners continue to ramp up risk mitigation and response measures, including water trucking and chlorination of water sources, disinfection of drainages, distribution of WASH kits and awareness messaging (including via radio) on the risks and response protocols. Although WASH and health partners agreed to a 3-month response plan to scale-up response for the entire rainy season, the declaration of an outbreak by the government is essential to provide the basis for resource mobilization to fund the plan. Cases will likely increase over the coming weeks as the rainy season gathers momentum.\n\nContingency planning for flooding during the peak of the rainy season\n\nGovernment (including State and National Emergency Management Agencies, SEMA/NEMA) and humanitarian partners convened a two-day workshop during the week to harmonize contingency plans for flood risks and impact across vulnerable locations in the state. The workshop reviewed trends of previous years, projections for this year (including the annual flooding outlook which identified some 179 most vulnerable locations in the state), current capacity of government and partners, likely challenges, and priority actions to follow up on. Possible funding opportunities including the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF) were also discussed. A draft document will be circulated with sectors and other stakeholders for inputs which will be harmonized to support advocacy efforts. Adamawa is usually the worst affected by flooding in the north- east during the rainy season, which is worsened by the release of water from the Lagdo Dam on the Cameroonian side.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nAdamawa State Situation Report No. 9 | 2\n\nOngoing advocacy with Government on the construction of information centers in out-of-camp areas\n\nProtection partners led by UNHCR and INTERSOS during the week intensified engagement with SEMA on the allocation/approval of land for the construction of information centers in out-of-camp areas across the state. The information centers will provide a platform for the improvement of protection monitoring and response, including timely identification of cases, follow-up and management of reported cases and support services for survivors. Partners had in recent weeks raised alarm over the surge of gender-based violence (GBV) cases targeting women and adolescent girls across camps, host communities and return areas in the state. The strengthening of the legal system, including laws to protect vulnerable groups and provide access to legal services/justice pathways, is another priority issue that partners are following up on with",

    "text": "39071\n\n\u00a9 UNICEF Nigeria\n\nWithin the reporting period: 11,969 boys and girls aged 6-59 months with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) were newly admitted for treatment in UNICEF supported nutrition sites; \uf0b7 168,030 of children, women and men were reached with integrated primary health care in UNICEF supported health facilities; \uf0b7 Renewed access to safe sanitation facilities were provided for 205,550 and 4,100 beneficiaries in the north-east and Benue states 3,877 girls and boys accessed community based psychosocial support services through UNICEF support in July; and UNICEF and partners improved access to education for an estimated 23,215 children.\n\nUNICEF\u2019s Response and Funding Status\n\nUNICEF Appeal 2020 US$ 145.1 million\n\nFunding Overview and Partnerships\n\nIn 2020, UNICEF is requesting US$ 145.1 million to provide life-saving services to 3.8 million people, including 2.2 million children. Funds currently available amount to US$ 58.5 million resulting in a 60 percent funding gap. UNICEF\u2019s ability to provide a sustained, integrated package of WASH, nutrition and health, child protection and education in emergencies services for the survival and development of vulnerable children is hampered by this lack of funding.\n\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Needs\n\nDuring the reporting month, flooding and windstorms as a result of the rain, continued to destroy properties including water and sanitation facilities. The temporary nature of construction coupled with years of wear and tear make the facilities vulnerable to strong windstorms and heavy rains. During the reporting period, 19 camps were affected in Maiduguri, Jere, Kaga and Konduga Local Government Areas (LGAs). The worst-hit of the camps assessed left 118 makeshift shelters damaged and an estimated 342 individuals without shelter in Maiduguri and in Damboa, 199\n\nmakeshift shelters were damaged leaving an estimated 808 individuals without shelter. Major needs include shelter, shelter repair kits, provision of basic NFI as well as reconstruction of damaged toilets and shower areas.\n\nAs a result of the flood, acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) cases were recorded in MMC and Monguno. Humanitarian partners on the ground are working with health facilities in their areas to follow-up on cases and implement response measures to contain the spread. In Adamawa, sporadic cases of AWD cases were reported in Yola North and Mubi.\n\nHealth and WASH partners held meetings to discuss response activities in the affected areas.\n\nThe time table for humanitarian programme cycle was announced by United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) with sectors and partners expected to commence preparation for developing the\n\nPeople in Need (PiN) by August 19, Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) by September 15, Inter Sector Need\n\nAnalysis by September 20 with planned publication of the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) by December 15.\n\nIncidents of violence continue daily in Sokoto and Zamfara states, with little media attention and reporting available. Such incidents are now occurring in areas not previously known for them as seen in Tangaza LGA of Sokoto state where hundreds of villagers were recently displaced as a result of an attack by \u201cbandits\u201d.\n\nIn addition to displacements due to violence, recent flooding in several LGAs of the two states have also led to loss of lives and properties with some displacements in several LGAs of the states. Crops were also washed away by heavy\n\nrains in Goronyo LGA of Sokoto state. With the current severe economic downtown due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\nthis situation is worsening the status of rural families, as well as, exposing vulnerable women and children to health and nutrition challenges.\n\nSummary Analysis of Programme Response\n\nThere was a 99 per cent (431 of 432) reporting completion rate from nutrition service sites supported by UNICEF in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States in July. A total of 11,969 boys and girls aged 6-59 months with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) were newly admitted for treatment. All the discharge performance indicators for the Out-Patient Therapeutic Programme (OTP) were within the recommended Sphere standards with 96.2 per cent cure rate, 2.8 per cent defaulter rate, 0.4 per cent death rate and 0.6 per cent of non-responders.",

    "text": "14575\n\nLIBYA: Floods in the South - West\n\nFLASH UPDATE 2 As of 11 June 2019\n\nThis report is produced by OCHA Libya in collaboration with the inter sector coordination group and the humanitarian partners.\n\nWater flood levels dropped and the weather in Ghat municipality has cleared.\n\nOver 20,000 persons have been affected and about 4,250 are currently displaced; of those, 1,200 are hosted in five collective shelters habilitated by the\n\nFour people died, including three children, and about 30 suffered minor injuries.\n\nMajor risk of diseases outbreaks including acute watery diarrhea due to water contamination.\n\nNeeds priorities are shifting from household level lifesaving to community level basic service needs.\n\nSituation overview\n\nThe situation of Ghat municipality, south \u2013 west Libya, has been stable since 7 June. the weather has cleared up\n\nand water flood levels dropped in most areas after heavy rains shocked the far southwest municipality of Ghat and its peripheries since 28 May. Area 304, Chinese Company area, Bent Libya, Alberket and Fayout were\n\namong the areas that have been badly affected. Houses and public infrastructure, including farmlands, roads and\n\nschools were severely damaged. The elementary and middle school official exams are still on-hold. The floods resulted in 34 casualties, including four fatalities and 30 minor injuries. Reportedly, there are missing persons who could be trapped by the floods.\n\nDue to water infrastructure damages and contamination there is a high risk of disease outbreak. An increased number of acute watery diarrhea cases were reported, mainly children. To date, 22 confirmed cases have been confirmed. Health and WASH sectors are working together to minimize the risk and respond.\n\nTelecommunication network has been fixed and electricity is operational in some areas of the municipality. Solid waste management, especially of dead animals, and disinfection of boreholes are expected to be of top priority needs.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.\n\nWe advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nFlash Update | 2\n\nAt least 4,250 people (850 families) are confirmed to have been displaced by IOM/DTM teams. According to the Ghat Emergency Cell and humanitarian partners on the ground, five collective shelters are hosting about 1,200 internally displaced persons; three schools in Ghat city and two schools in Alberket town, 7 km south of Ghat city; while others joined friends and relatives in safer areas. Immediate needs were provided by the Libyan Red Crescent, national and local authorities, and sectors\u2019 partners operational in the region. After the initial first days and with the immediate shelter and\n\nfood needs covered, needs are shifting from household lifesaving to community level basic service provision. Needs pertaining to refugees and migrants need to be identified.\n\nHumanitarian Needs and Response\n\nDue to the pre-existing needs in Ghat over the past years, situation has been exacerbated with the current floods. Despite limited improvements in the impacted areas, logistics remain challenging and hindered a humanitarian needs assessment. Based on the rapid NFI and market assessment conducted by IOM/DTM, bakeries, food markets and markets in general reported to be closed; however, the Eid holiday needs to be factored. With the weather improvements and the water receding, humanitarian actors are expecting smoother operations in the coming days. OCHA is relocating a national officer\n\nto Ghat to work closely with the Emergency Cell and strengthen coordination with local actors and the humanitarian organizations responding to the crisis.\n\nShelter/Non-Food Items (NFI) Within the first 72 hours following the flooding in Ghat, assistance was provided to around 700 displaced families in the\n\nform of NFI family packages by local and international humanitarian actors. An additional 550 families are currently targeted to be assisted and emergency shelters (130 tents) with capacity for 650 people have been propositioned to cover the needs of displaced population in the opened spaces by UNHCR. Five Collective shelters have been habilitated by the local authorities and humanitarian local and international partners, such as IOM, pre-positioned supplies in Sebha ready to be transported to Ghat in case additional needs are identified. 600 to 1,100 additional families could be assisted.",

It also includes the increase of the out-of-the-camp population in White Nile State by 79,000 based on as inter-agency assessment targeting out-of-camp locations. The revised total population figure is reflected in the 2019-2020 Refugee Response Plan (RRP) and in the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) and Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). The revised figure will not affect RRP or HRP budgets, as refugee programming is based on assessed needs.\n\nOperational Update\n\nCASH AND FUEL SHORTAGES DRIVING RESPONSE DELAYS \u2013 Persistent cash shortages is delaying assistance projects in all refugee locations, especially for procurement activities and the implementation of cash-based interventions. The situation is compounded by logistical delays due to ongoing fuel shortages.

UNHCR provided a two-month supply of drugs to the health centre at Dar Batti settlement in El Leri to support the health needs of over 6,000 refugees and host community members who regularly access the centre. Care International Switzerland (CIS) is supporting scale up of hygiene interventions for refugees in El Leri, including distribution of 3-month supply of soap to over 9,600 refugees. CIS also distributed personal hygiene kits (PHKs) to address the menstrual hygiene needs of over 2,700 refugee women and girls for the next 3-months. Additional support is needed to cover PHK needs throughout 2019 for an estimated 4,000 refugee women and girls in El Leri.\n\nDURABLE SHELTER CONSTRUCTION ONGOING IN WHITE NILE STATE \u2013 The Government\u2019s Commission for Refugees (COR) and the Sudanese Red Crescent Society (SRCS) supported the construction of 63 durable shelters (\u2018tukuls\u2019) with the refugee community in White Nile State\u2019s newest refugee camp Al Jamey\u2019a. Each shelter can accommodate up to 5 people. The new tukuls are part of a pilot for durable shelter in Al Jamey\u2019a in White Nile State, and aligns with efforts to enhance the sustainability of the response in White Nile State through investments in improved camp infrastructure. Tukuls are being constructed by community members with partner support to enhance refugees\u2019 active participation in the response. Construction will continue into 2019 to replace emergency shelters being used in the interim by nearly 6,200 refugees living at the new",

    "text": "13033\n\nAs global lead of the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC), the World Food Programme (WFP) is convening the Emergency Telecommunications Sector (ETS) in Nigeria, responding with government, private sector and humanitarian partners on the ground to ensure a coordinated response. ETS SitReps are issued monthly.\n\nThe ETS assisted the UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) in relocating the Security Communications Centre (SCC) in Abuja and in conducting a refresher training for radio\n\nTwo connectivity kits part of the Crisis\n\nConnectivity Charter were received in Maiduguri for testing purposes before its deployment to field hub locations in North-East Nigeria.\n\nThe ETS received a contribution of US$883,000 from the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO).\n\nSituation Overview\n\nThe security situation across North-East Nigeria continues to be extremely volatile and unpredictable. On the evening of 8 April 2019 the Nigerian military ordered the immediate departure and forced the relocation of up to 10,000 civilians from Jakana town to Bakassi camp for internally displaced people in Maiduguri, Borno State.\n\nAccording to official sources, civilians were relocated for security reasons ahead of planned operations in the\n\narea. The United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr. Edward Kallon, called on the Government of Nigeria to provide humanitarian assistance to and protect the forcedly displaced people from Jakana.\n\nOver the Easter weekend, two humanitarians from Mercy Corps and the International NGO Security Organisation (INSO) were killed in a resort in Kaduna, close to Abuja.\n\nETS Response\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the ETS has provided Internet connectivity services to over 2,000 humanitarians from 75 organisations at the hubs deployed across North-East Nigeria. Monguno, Banki and Dikwa are the humanitarians hubs with a higher daily average number of ETS Internet users - 71, 40 and 37 respectively. In a given day, more than 180 devices are connected simultaneously on the ETS network at the Red Roof base camp in Maiduguri.\n\nThe ETS assisted in relocating the UNDSS SCC in Abuja and conducted a refresher training for radio operators to efficiently conduct their jobs. This SCC in Abuja will cover communications operations countrywide, including North-East Nigeria.\n\nThe ETS started the development of training materials for technical and non-technical humanitarians responding in North-East Nigeria to build their skills on security communications services and infrastructure. These activities underpin the provision and support to communications services in the long term.\n\nDuring the reporting period, preventive maintenance missions were carried out on the ETS infrastructure and services deployed in Bama, Banki and Ngala to ensure their full operability and better support humanitarian activities. In Ngala, the ETS team managed to restore the VHF coverage up to Gamburo-\n\nbordering town with Cameroon- and beyond.\n\nThe ETS received in Maiduguri two satellite kits part of the Crisis Connectivity Charter to test the solutions ahead of future activations of the Charter. One of them was mounted at the Red Roof humanitarian base camp. The ETS team will test their performance in Maiduguri before deploying them in two field humanitarian hubs in North-East Nigeria.\n\nThe ETS delivered a module on standard communications procedures to 19 humanitarians from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) during the Safe and Secure Approaches to Field Environments (SSAFE) training organised by the UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) in Maiduguri. The training ensured that participants familiarised themselves with handheld radios and focused on practical exercises to confidently conduct radio checks and contact the Communications Centre (COMCEN) when required.",

    "text": "32344\n\nECUADOR \u2013 LIVELIHOODS COVID-19 Update 22 June 2020\n\nKey Figures\n\nSituational Highlights\n\nEcuador is the second hardest hit economy by COVID-19 in the region after Venezuela, according to a special report released by ECLAC on 21 April. Ecuador's GDP will decrease 6.5 per cent in 2020, in the context of a global recession due to the COVID-19 crisis and the fall in the price of crude oil.\n\nThe unemployment rate is expected to increase 8 per cent between 2020 and 2022 and the population in extreme poverty will increase by 66 per cent in 2020, based on World Bank projections. Many supply chains have been disrupted due to confinement and steep reductions in demand.\n\nPersons of concern to UNHCR, in particular Venezuelans who were already in precarious conditions before the COVID- 19 crisis, are especially affected by restrictive lockdown measures as a result of the health emergency. The vast majority works in the informal sector and lacks a social safety-net. Not being able to go out and make a living, they are unable to cover their basic needs, such as rent and food. Many are evicted and end up on the street where they are subject to xenophobia, discrimination and other protection risks. A short survey conducted by UNHCR with 528 persons of concern revealed that 70 per cent of businesses could only resist a \u201cno-sales\u201d period of 0 to 15 days. After a three months lockdown, 65 per cent of businesses have totally closed their operations, and 30 per cent partially.\n\nUNHCR\u2019s Response\n\nUNHCR, together with IOM, co-leads the inter-agency response to the Venezuela situation. UNHCR participates in the Early Recovery Working Group (part of the Humanitarian Country Team) to coordinate livelihoods activities with other UN Agencies and NGOs and ensure alignment with Government programmes and UNHCR has redirected its focus on the reactivation of livelihoods lost due to COVID-19, by identifying shifting demands for jobs, products and services as a result of the pandemic. Examples are production of protective equipment (e.g. face masks) and door to door deliveries. \u2022 In alliance with the Alliance for Entrepreneurship and Innovation and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, UNHCR supports the design of a more inclusive strategy to promote entrepreneurship and innovation. \u2022 One-hundred and eighty-three young refugees and Ecuadorians participating in the \u201cA Ganar\u201d Programme have been able to continue their vocational training through virtual courses, thanks to an agreement between Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica and FUDELA.\n\nUNHCR is encouraging multi-stakeholder dialogues with the private sector and local Governments, to reactivate supply-chains affected by COVID-19. The dialogues promote solutions with a social, economic and environmental impact. They will be inclusive (social impact), market-oriented in response to the \u201cnew normal\u201d (economic impact) and will use environmentally friendly technologies (environmental impact).\n\nUNHCR and UNDP are implementing a joint strategy to support the recovery of small businesses through the programme #EnMarchaDigital, while creating new jobs for refugees and vulnerable Ecuadorians in delivery services.\n\nThrough its partners -Fundaci\u00f3n HIAS, Fundaci\u00f3n AVSI, FUDELA, FEPP and ConQuito- UNHCR is supporting the recovery and creation of new livelihoods through innovation and adaptation of small enterprises to new consumer demands, in line with contagion containment guidelines and biosafety recommendations.\n\nThe Graduation Model: reaching families living in extreme poverty\n\nSince 2015 Ecuador is implementing the Graduation Model, a comprehensive programme of support for refugees who are economically active or have the potential to generate income and find themselves in a situation of vulnerability. The Graduation Model consists of a package of services provided in a sequenced and time-bound fashion that combines elements of social protection, livelihoods development, and financial inclusion.\n\nRead the story of Valeria and Osmar, a Venezuelan family selected to participate in the Graduation Model.",

In IDP Hosting Sites some 465,000 IDPs live in close to 1,300 Sites, often as a last resort, and are considered among the most vulnerable populations with no means to support more adequate shelter solutions. Returnees are no better off with at least 10 % with no shelter or settled in makeshift shelters while 6% reside in IDP hosting sites due to multiple factors including damage to their homes, security and safety and limited access to basic services and livelihood opportunities. There has been an 84% increase in needs from 1.2 M people in 2015 and 24%\n\nincrease from 5.4 M in 2018 to 6.7 M in 2019.

    "text": "47104\n\nThe COVID-19 situation continued deteriorating throughout the country. As of 30 December 2020, 11,344 cases of COVID-19 were officially conirrmed by the Minister of Health in government-held areas in Syria, marking a 44 percent increase compared to the national rate of COVID-19 cases at the end of November. At the same time, the official COVID-19 related mortality rate in government-held areas across Syria has witnessed a two-thirds increase compared to a month earlier, reaching 704 COVID-19 fatalities in December. Addi- tionally, since reopening schools in September 2020, sharp rises of COVID-19 cases in schools have been recorded, reaching 1,540 cases in 10 December. Highlighting challenges in preventing COVID-19 transmission in schools, given overcrowded classrooms, and dam- aged infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile, a surge of COVID-19 cases was observed among populations in opposition-held areas in northwest Syria, reaching around 20,204 cases of COVID-19 by the end of December. Representing a one-third increase above the announced rate of COVID-19 cases at the end of November. The most affected areas were reported in Idleb city, Dana and Afrin sub-districts, together accounting for some half of all conirrmed cases in opposition-held areas in northwest Syria. Highlighting a concern given colder winter months approaching, as well as, some 10 percent of the announced COVID-19 cases were living in camps and most people reported difficulties in following sanitation and hygiene measures.\n\nIncreased hostilities were reported in northwest Syria during December, where 2.7 million people remain displaced and an estimated 80 percent of people in IDP sites are women and children. Explosive hazards and tensions between non-state armed groups were also observed in northwest Syria, highlighting a volatile security situation that is hindering safe access to highly vulnerable people who are in urgent need of life-saving assistance. Such escalation of violence continues impacting humanitarian workers in Syria; vehicle-borne IED (improvised explosive devises) attacks have caused around 10 aid worker casualties in the course of 2020, recording the highest observed level over the prolonged Syrian conflict since 2011.\n\nThe wheat crisis in Syria continued impacting bread shortfalls across the government-held areas during December. This is exacerbated due to the Syrian government\u2019s reduced control over the country\u2019s richest wheat-producing regions; around 70 percent of total wheat production comes from Kurdish-held areas in northeast Syria. In addition, the plummeting of the Syrian pound and unilateral coercive measures on Syria complicated efforts to procure wheat on the open market. In response, the Syrian government has strengthened agricultural support for wheat farmers by providing subsidized wheat seed and fertilizer to cultivate wheat in a bid to address the limited national wheat reserves for the coming year.\n\nMajor humanitarian needs persisted across all sectors in Syria, compounded by the ongoing economic downturn, increasing incidents of violence, and COVID-19 outbreak. In response to the multiple disruptive shocks in Syria, WFP dispatched food rations to around 4.7 million people countrywide in December 2020, including commodities for 1.4 million people delivered cross-border into northwest Syria.

The phone numbers were generated using random-digit dial- ing. In December 2020, data was collected from a sample of 1,296 respondents across 13 governorates. As per standard survey proce- dures, respondents\u2019 consent was obtained prior to the interviews. For security and safety measures, all respondents were identiired with an anonymous ID.",

    "text": "54802\n\nWFP Central Sahel Situation Report 3 April 2021\n\nAs of 28 March 2021, WHO reported 27,433 confirmed cumulative COVID-19 cases in the Central Sahel countries: Burkina Faso (12,673), Mali (9,773) and Niger (4,987). This represents a 75 percent increase since 29 December 2020 (15,361 cases). So far 706 people in the three Central Sahel countries lost their lives due to the pandemic (53 percent in Mali, 26 percent in Niger and 21 percent in Burkina\n\nWFP has started planning the lean season assistance to the most vulnerable populations in the Central Sahel countries that begins in June, when food and nutrition assistance are most acute. However, critical funding deficit is affecting the emergency response.\n\n\u25aa In Burkina Faso, WFP was forced to implement a prioritization plan from March for its emergency operations. Both in-kind rations and cash-based transfers were reduced, as well as coverage, to ensure continued assistance to at least 700,000 IDPs. A 75 percent ration is provided in hard-to-reach areas, prioritizing assistance where access was more difficult and irregular; in all other locations, WFP provides a 50 percent ration. Other beneficiary groups (refugees and host- communities) residing in these localities also have their rations reduced to avoid any intercommunal tension among targeted groups. Furthermore, urgent funding is needed for the upcoming lean season, as currently less than 15 percent of the required resources is available for WFP to assist 1.4 million vulnerable people for three months. \u25aa In Mali, a lack of resources is expected from May 2021, affecting 414,210 beneficiaries including 127,000 IDPs and 137,280 COVID- 19-affected people. This funding gap is likely to quickly increase for the lean season from June to September with WFP requiring funds in advance to ensure food is prepositioned.\n\n\u25aa In Niger, the most significant and urgent lack of resources remains under the emergency response as well and need to be addressed to continue providing assistance to vulnerable IDPs, refugees and host communities in the coming months. The prices of local foodstuffs is increasing significantly, and WFP will probably need to downscale its cash-based assistance and further increase food transfers. This increase in market prices, combined with the already fragile security context and the lean season period fast approaching (starting in April for herders), is paving the road for a food crisis that will likely materialize in the coming months.\n\nWFP urgently requires USD 338 million from April to September 2021 to carry out its planned lifesaving operations in the Central Sahel and pre-position relief items before the lean season.\n\nCaption: WFP resilience activities in Niger \u2013 Baby Nana receives Plumpy Sup.

    "text": "57939\n\nGIEWS Country Brief\n\nReference Date: 15-June-2021\n\nFavourable production prospects for 2021 paddy and maize crops\n\nThe harvest of the 2021 minor paddy crop is ongoing and yields are reportedly at an above-average level reflecting favourable weather conditions in the main producing departments of Tolima, Huila, Meta and Casanare. The planted area of the minor season is officially estimated at a record level, as the year-on-year higher prices at the planting period (between August and November 2020), coupled with adequate weather conditions, prompted farmers to expand sowings.\n\nThe 2021 main paddy crop has been recently planted and will be harvested from July. Sowings have likely declined as large supplies from the 2020 record harvest pushed prices down in the first quarter of 2021. However, yield prospects are generally favourable as weather forecasts point to average precipitation and temperatures in the key cropping areas during the July-August 2021 period. The aggregate 2021 paddy production is preliminarily forecast at 2.86 million tonnes, about 5 percent above the previous five-year average.\n\nThe 2021 main season maize crop is currently at flowering and grain filling stages. According to satellite imagery, crop conditions are overall good in the main producing coastal areas (ASI map). The 2021 aggregate maize production, including the minor season crop harvested in the first quarter of 2021, is forecast slightly above the average at 1.5 million tonnes. This represents an annual increase of 5 percent, prompted by a rebound in\n\nThe high level of plantings and yields of the 2021 cereal crops also reflects the expansion of governmental agricultural support GIEWS global information and early warning system on food and agriculture\n\nprogrammes (Juntos por el Campo), launched in August 2020. The programmes aim to provide subsidized agricultural machinery and inputs to smallholder farmers and to improve farmers\u2019 access to credit. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, credit allocation during the first quarter of 2021 increased by 32 percent compared to the same period in 2020.\n\nCereal import requirements in 2021 forecast at high levels\n\nAbout 85 percent of the country\u2019s cereal consumption needs are covered by imports. Cereal import requirements in the 2021 marketing year (January/December) are forecast at 8.57 million tonnes, similar to the record level in 2020. The anticipated high level of requirements reflects strong demand for maize by the feed sector and for wheat for human consumption. In responses to the weakening domestic currency, the import tariff for wheat was reduced to zero in mid-2020 for a period of two years.\n\nPrices of rice well below year-earlier levels\n\nPrices of rice declined steadily in the first four months of 2021, pressured by large supplies from the record 2020 output and the above-average 2021 minor season harvest. In May 2021, the declining trend was reversed, as protests and blockades of the country\u2019s main roads disrupted market activities. Despite the month-on-month increase, prices in May 2021 were about 25 percent below their year-earlier levels, reflecting abundant market availabilities.\n\nPrices of yellow maize, mostly imported, increased significantly between March and May 2021, reflecting high international prices and negative effects of the social unrest. As of May 2021, prices of yellow maize were about 8 percent higher than the same month in 2020. By contrast, prices of domestically produced white maize were lower year on year due to adequate supplies from the 2021 minor season harvest.\n\nRising concerns about adequate access to food in urban areas\n\nOfficial estimates by the Statistics Department (DANE) indicate that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined by 6.7 percent in 2020 due to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, the poverty rate increased by 6.8 percentage points year on year and about 3.6 million people felt into poverty, especially in urban areas, due to job and income losses during the",

    "text": "54290\n\nHEALTH SITUATION\n\nCOVID-19 update As of 31 March, there have been 4,533 reported cases and 164 deaths in 18 provinces. The number of new weekly cases has been in decline for three consecutive weeks. To this date, no vaccination program has yet been launched in Chad, however discussions are ongoing between GAVI, WHO \u2013 through the COVAX initiative \u2013 and the Ministry of Public Health.\n\nHUMANITARIAN SITUATION\n\nBatha province Returnees and refugees from Niger in dire need of humanitarian assistance. In recent years, Chad has hosted an increasing number of refugees and returnees, especially following major disasters and serious attacks on human life and property. The loss of livelihood has put many people at risk of insecurity, triggering further displacement. Hundreds of returnees and refugees from Niger have recently fled to the Abouhadjilidj area, in the Batha-Ouest department, after their village \u2013 Amtamour (Niger) - was attacked and burned down by non- state armed groups. The displaced include Nigeriens as well as Chadians from various provinces who had left Chad decades earlier to live in localities in Niger, near the Lac province. During a rapid assessment mission conducted between 27 February and 4 March, the Chadian and French Red Cross teams observed a disastrous\n\nliving situation for the displaced population from Niger. The returnees and refugees are now camped in a locality near the village of Boulwa, about 30 km from Abouhadjilidj. The mission reported 400 displaced people, including 150 under-five children and 45 pregnant women. These people have received food aid from the population of Abouhadjilidj, but the quantities are insufficient to cover all needs. Deprived of means of livelihood, they feed on wild foods for survival and have to walk at least 500m to find untreated open well water. According to the assessment, they are in a situation of global insecurity caused by the lack of means of subsistence, particularly water, hygiene, protection, shelter, food, healthcare, etc. In order to address this situation, an assistance program has been deemed necessary, namely in terms of cash or in-kind assistance, repair or replacement of damaged assets, contributions to families, relief and recovery programs to protect livelihoods and prevent further loss. UNICEF is organizing an urgent distribution of non-food items and the construction of a borehole at the site. The emergency will be brought to the attention of the ICC to seek the engagement of humanitarian partners and explore further response opportunities. (French Red Cross)\n\nFrench Embassy grants funding to the French Red Cross and the NGO Echo Medical for the fight against malnutrition. The project of the French Red Cross in Chad entitled \"Strengthening the resilience of communities in the prevention and management of acute malnutrition in the health district of Bokoro\" will receive a funding of 500,000 EUR (about 328 million CFA francs). The French Red Cross will implement its project for 12 months in the health district of Bokoro, in the province of Hadjer-Lamis, which is one of 13 provinces out of 23 in Chad\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.

    "text": "11820\n\nUNICEF remains extremely concerned about the situation of more than 25,000 people who are still sleeping under open skies in Monguno and Maiduguri Teachers Village, and for whom there is currently no plan for relocation. There is an urgent need for the identification of additional land in these two locations, so that shelters, WASH facilities and other structures can be prepared before the start of the rainy season. In Rann (Kale Balge LGA), an estimated 40,000 people remain highly vulnerable and without humanitarian assistance. This population had fled into Cameroon as a result of attacks on 14 and 27 January. However, at the request of Nigerian and Cameroonian authorities, most of the population returned to Rann in late February. The number of measles cases has increased sharply across Borno State, especially among children arriving from hard-to-reach areas. Over 2,000 cases have been reported in 18 LGAs and 18 IDP camps, with 6 LGAs accounting for most cases. Plans for a large-scale reactive measles campaign are underway.\n\nUNICEF\u2019s response with partners The worsening security situation in northeast Nigeria continues to exacerbate humanitarian needs, however, shortage of funding at 68 per cent is hindering UNICEF\u2019s ability to deliver an integrated\n\n*Total Results are cumulative, since January 2018\n\nSituation Report\n\n1-28 February 2019 4.2 million Children in need of humanitarian assistance\n\n(Humanitarian Response Plan, 2019)\n\n7.1 million People in need of humanitarian assistance in the northeast states of Borno, Adamawa & Yobe (HRP, 2019)\n\n6.1 million People targeted in the northeast states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (HRP, 2019)\n\n1.76 million Internally displaced people in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states (IOM DTM Round XXIV, January 2019)\n\nUNICEF Appeal 2019 US$ 120.1 million\n\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Needs The number of displaced people in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States ostensibly reduced by 3 per cent - to 1.76 million\n\npeople - since the publication of the last IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix in October 2018. It should be noted, however, that this reduction is attributed not to a decrease in population movement, but to decreased access to assess all conflict- affected areas. Since December 2018, aid workers and enumerators alike lost their ability to sustainably assess and respond to humanitarian needs in two LGAs of Borno State, Kala Balge and Kukawa. This brings the total of inaccessible LGAs in Borno to five (along with Abadam, Marte and Guzamala, where there has not been any provision of humanitarian assistance or services since the start of the conflict).\n\nBorno continues to host the highest number of IDPs (more than 1.4 million)1. During the reporting period (IOM ETT Reports 104-108), over 14,873 new arrivals were registered in Borno and Yobe states with Monguno, Maiduguri, Gwoza and Ngala registering the highest numbers of new arrivals. The key drivers behind these population movements are conflict/military operations, fear of attack, poor living condition, and voluntary relocation. The priority needs for the returnees and the IDPs remain shelter, access to water and sanitation, health and nutrition services and provision of food.\n\nThe humanitarian situation remains particularly precarious among recent arrivals in Monguno and Maiduguri IDP camps, where the delivery of services and assistance are significantly undermined by the lack of available land. More than 25,000 are currently sleeping under open skies, and will not be able to move into new shelters until additional land for the creation of camps is identified. The planned relocation of new arrivals in the overcrowded Teachers Village Camp to the newly established Stadium camp is now underway, following some initial challenges linked to the premature movement of IDPs in advance of the official starting date.\n\nThe worsening security situation in northeast Nigeria continues to exacerbate humanitarian needs. Of particular concern is the situation of an estimated 40,000 people who fled from the town of Rann (Kale Balge LGA) into Cameroon following attacks on 14 and 27 January, in which dozens of civilians were reportedly killed. The majority of this population returned to Rann at the end of February, after being encouraged to do so by Nigerian and Cameroonian authorities. However, since their arrival, lack of humanitarian access in and around Rann has resulted in the inability of humanitarian actors to provide support to highly vulnerable people.",

Figures for 2019 are partial and preliminary and can be subject to changes\n\nViolence and insecurity continue unabated in northern of Central America. In El Salvador, although the number of homicides and missing persons reportedly fell in the first half of 2020 as compared to 2019, civil society organizations report the human rights situation has worsened during 2020, particularly violence against women and internet crimes. In addition, members of the LGBTI community continue to report discrimination and violence, heightening their vulnerability to internal forced displacement and extortion.\n\nIn 2020, Honduras registered 30 massacres that killed a total of 110 persons, 40% of which took place in the Central District (including Tegucigalpa and Comayag\u00fcela). According to the National Police, the increase in murders in the Central District is a result of the expansion of criminal activities (drug trafficking, extortions) of gangs and disputes over control of the territory. UNHCR has observed an increase in SGBV cases, with 30 registered in San Pedro Sula between 14 March and 12 August, 60% of whom among deportees.\n\nIn Guatemala, the homicide rate, activities by gangs and other organized crime groups are reportedly increasing since the COVID- 19 traffic light system was put in place. Several violent events have reportedly forced 40 indigenous families off their land after an armed group set fire to several of their residences, according to the information provided by a land rights group.\n\nUNHCR and partners continue to provide assistance to persons of concern, and to advance on community-based interventions to ensure continuity of humanitarian access in prioritized high-risk communities affected by the increasing levels of violence.\n\nFUNDING (AS OF 1 SEPTEMBER 2020)\n\nFACT SHEET > NCA Situation / August 2020\n\nUNHCR Response and Strategy UNHCR works with over 70 partners in the region and supports states to implement their national plans under the Regional Comprehensive Protection and Solutions Framework (MIRPS). The MIRPS is a pioneering application of the Global Compact on Refugees in Central America and Mexico. A Plenary Meeting of MIRPS States took place and the Pro-tempore Presidency, currently held by El Salvador, reported on the implementation of the annual work plan. MIRPS countries presented their requests related to protection and strengthening of asylum systems to MIRPS Support Platform Presidency to receive bilateral cooperation.\n\nMain Activities Alongside governments, partner organizations, civil society, faith-based organizations, development actors and UN Agencies, UNHCR undertakes protection and solutions activities, including:\n\nAdvocacy and Coordination In Guatemala, UNHCR advances on the Temporary Care Arrangement programme to strengthen the inclusion of refugees and asylum-seeking children within the national child protection system through the review of protocols, the identification of families, and the follow-up on psychosocial support. In Panama, through partner HIAS, a participatory assessment was conducted with children and adolescents on safe spaces, education and COVID-19. Through the Protection Cluster in El Salvador, UNHCR led the design of a capacity-building programme for the Directorate of Attention to Victims and Forced Migration on international protection, forced displacement and humanitarian issues.",

    "text": "17742\n\nInformation bulletin no. 1 Colombia and Ecuador:\n\nUNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNOCHA, UNWOMEN, World Vision Ecuador, WFP and WHO\n\nThis bulletin is being issued for information and reflects the current situation and details available at this time. The Red Cross Societies of Colombia and Ecuador, with the support of the Emergency Appeals launched by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), are seeking funding and other assistance from donors.\n\nP a g e | 2\n\nThe situation\n\nSince August 23, 2019, Ecuador has witnessed an increased number of Venezuelan nationals entering through the international bridge of Rumichaca, due to new migratory measures established by the Ecuadorian Government.\n\nAccording to the new measures announced by the Government, as of from 26 August 2019, all Venezuelan citizens will need a humanitarian visa to Enter Ecuador. Because of these new regulations, the flow of people entering Ecuador has increased considerably over the past days (according to Migracion Colombia, the Colombian Photo 1: Volunteer from Ecuadorian Red Cross supporting in the national migration authority, this increased by 30 percent compared to previous weeks) and reached peaks of 3,000 people entering daily in Ecuador. The measure is based on Executive Decree 826 of July 25 and aims to organize migratory flows under the principles of orderly, regular and safe migration. On 23 August 2019, the Colombian municipality of Ipiales declared a state of emergency following the announcement of this measure and to respond to an increased number of people trying to cross to Ecuador. On 26 August, a sanitary emergency was declared by the municipality of Ipiales as there was no running water due to damage to an aquaduct; by the following day, the damage had mostly been repaired. In the evening of 26 August, protests at the border were reported; police were deployed to both sides of the border.\n\nMigracion Colombia reports that on the weekend of 24 and 25 August, more than 11,000 Venezuelan citizens were able to complete the migratory process to leave Colombian territory through the Rumichaca border. In the morning of 27 August, a significant decrease in the flow of migrants between the north-eastern border of Colombia and Venezuela (Norte de Santander) was noted. From Ipiales, it is reported that there are very few persons crossing the border, and police presence is noted. As of the afternoon of 28 August, approximately 800 persons, including families with children, were reported around the border at Rumichaca, unable to cross.\n\nPhoto 2: The Rumichaca border crossing on the morning of 25 August 2019. Source: Colombian Red Cross.\n\nDue to an increase in people crossing the international bridge in Rumichaca, people at the National Border Centre offices (CENAF by its acronym in Spanish), especially families traveling with young children and adolescents, have not been able to access the Refugee Housing Unit (RHU\u00b4s) or other locally available shelter facilities because of limited capacity (approximately only 250 places for pregnant women, women with children, and elderly people) and are therefore spending the night in the open. The government of Ecuador is working with the Ministry of Economic and\n\nP a g e | 3\n\nSocial Inclusion (MIES) and UNICEF to ensure protection measures and protocols are in place for unaccompanied minors or for those requiring special protection.\n\nFrom May 2017 to July 2019, 1,673,980 Venezuelans have entered Ecuador, of whom 341,561 have remained in the country, more than 115,000 of them with visas. As of July 25, 2019, the number of Venezuelan people that entered the country increased. Between July 26 and August 2 of this year, 13,713 Venezuelans entered the country, with an average of 1,714 people daily. From August 3 to 25, the day prior to the visa requirement, an average of 3,704 people entered the country daily. 1\n\nThis chart shows the number of people entering Ecuador during the month of August through the two main border points between Colombia to Ecuador.

(Pre-departure testing is a requirement of the Tunisian Government, which stipulates that all UN staff entering Tunisia must present a recent negative COVID-19 test on arrival.) Approximately 400 tests will be needed to cover tests for UN staff over the next two months. The head of the NCDC has agreed that the UN may set aside 400 COVID-19 rapid tests from the 4300 that are due to arrive in Misrata on 19 July. The UN will replenish these 400 tests as soon as additional supplies reach the country and will provide enough tests to the NCDC to cover the testing of all UN personnel until the end of the year. The UN will also cover the salary of a laboratory technician for an initial six months to support COVID-19 testing of UN personnel. This technician will be assigned to work at the NCDC central laboratory. The sole manufacturer of COVID-19 tests (Cephid) has informed WHO that no order has been placed for the 50 000 tests to be procured by the MoH. WHO has written to the head of the COVID-19 Scientific Committee to express its concern over these delays, given the already acute shortages of tests in the country. The Deputy Minister of Health and the head of the Scientific Committee have asked WHO to contact the supplier and arrange for the invoice to be sent for direct payment. In cooperation with the Ministry of Health and the Technical Advisory Committee of the Presidential Council, WHO participated in an assessment of the levels of readiness and preparedness undertaken at municipality level to contain COVID-19.\n\no The national preparedness and response plan for COVID-19 has still not been endorsed by the national authorities. This has exacerbated the already fragmented response across the country. Only Tripoli and\n\nBenghazi have some capacity to respond, while other areas, especially in the south, continue to perform poorly due to lack of capacity and resources. WHO is disseminating daily updates showing new and cumulative figures for COVID-19. WHO has conducted a gap analysis on the COVID-19 in the southern region and prepared recommendations.\n\no WHO and partners (IRC, UNICEF, GIZ and IOM) have developed a separate COVID-19 RRCE action plan for the response across the south. o WHO also participated in an online meeting on RCCE support. The outcome was a rapid action plan for Sebha and the creation of an RRCE working group for the southwest. o WHO participated in the launch of a national awareness campaign for the southern region, led by the head of the NCDC. o The RCCE working group is planning to conduct a behavioural assessment on COVID-19. The findings of the assessment will be used to identify the most strategic ways of disseminating messages on prevention and risk-\n\nreduction behaviours and prepare a communications plan accordingly.\n\no WHO is continuing to follow up on all newly registered cases across the country. o Between 30 June and 6 July 2020, 51 patients were admitted to isolation facilities in Tripoli. Of these patients, 21 required health care, seven required oxygen support and one was placed on a ventilator.\n\n3 | P a g e\n\n\n********* [PAGE 3 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 4 START] *********\n\nWHO has developed guidance on mortality surveillance and is ready to train national staff on the classification of deaths (COVID or non-COVID). Because of lack of capacity, the national IHR focal point is no longer reporting cases of COVID-19 to WHO\u2019s regional office in EMRO. WHO is planning another round of training for rapid response teams and is waiting for a list of candidates from the NCDC. There are discrepancies in the number of cases detected in the south, making it difficult to ascertain the spread of the disease out of Sebha. The NCDC needs to urgently intervene so as to obtain accurate information on the situation in the south. Sebha remains the epicentre. The absence of policies and procedures on quarantine and contact tracing, and poor compliance with self- isolation at home, are hampering efforts to conduct effective contact tracing.",

    "text": "6564\n\nThis report is produced by OCHA in collaboration with humanitarian partners. It is issued by the OCHA Yemen office. The next report will be issued when additional information on the emergency becomes available. ESCALATED CONFLICT IN AL HUDAYDAH GOVERNORATE Humanitarian situation in Al Hudaydah City\n\nOngoing fighting, the effective closure of the main Al Hudaydah-Sana\u2019a road, a further sharp depreciation in the Yemeni Rial, disruption to trade and the movement of commercial supplies and restricted humanitarian access have together led to a deterioration in the humanitarian situation in Al Hudaydah City. While some shops in the city remain open, supplies are running low; field reports indicate that shop owners are not replacing their stock, preferring to sell their supplies before deciding whether to close or move to another location. The little that is available is not affordable to most people. In villages on the outskirts of the city where the conflict rages, markets have ceased\n\nHumanitarian warehouses in areas of active conflict in Kilo 10 and Kilo 16, to the east of the city remain difficult to access. On 29 September, during a deconflicted operation at the Red Sea Mills, which are critical to the humanitarian response in Al Hudaydah and neighbouring governorates, the facility was shelled while trucks were being loaded with wheat flour. The military activity eventually ceased, and five loaded trucks proceeded safely to Bajil District. Increased access difficulties have prompted some partners to consider relocating supplies away from warehouses close to the frontlines.\n\nHealth needs\n\nAccording to WHO, only half of the health facilities in Al Hudaydah Governorate are still operational. In Al Hudaydah City, public hospitals are accessible and operational, but ongoing military operations have increased demand for health services such as trauma care and surgical supplies. The conflict has also damaged the water supply infrastructure, including sanitation facilities and water stations, limiting access to water and sanitation amenities and thereby increasing the risk of disease\n\nIn these circumstances, the population is at risk from various diseases, including cholera, diphtheria, measles and malaria. Suspected cholera cases have almost tripled in the Al Hudaydah Governorate since the escalation of fighting in June. Health facilities supported by Save the Children recorded a 170 per cent increase in the number\n\nto function or operate on a limited basis due to insecurity.\n\nGround fighting and airstrikes continued during the reporting period around Kilo 10, Kilo 16 and around the airport, but were less intense. Clashes were also reported in Hays and At Tuhayat districts in Al Hudaydah, as well as in Hayran District and Haradh Town in neighboring Hajjah Governorate. Civilian casualties have been reported, including 11 civilians who were reportedly injured in an air attack on a car park in Al Hali District in Al Hudaydah City. At least seven civilians were reported killed in the Kilo 16 area, and in Zabid, Al Khawkhah and Durayhimi districts. Houses and farms were also damaged.\n\nLocal authorities estimate that between 50 and 70 families are trapped by fighting in the southern part of Al Hudaydah city, without access to food, clean water or healthcare services. Tens of other families are trapped in zones of active fighting in Ad Durayhimi District and are in dire humanitarian need. In recent days, however, relatively few civilians have been seen leaving the city. This might indicate that families who could afford moving out of Al Hudaydah City have already left and that only poorest households with no means to leave are left in the city.\n\nof suspected cholera cases, from 497 in June to 1,342 in\n\nCholera vaccination is ongoing in Al Hudaydah. Photo: WHO\n\nEconomic impact\n\nA sharp decline in the value of the Yemeni Rial to 655YER/ US$ from 497YER/US$ in July, has resulted in another hike in commodity prices and further devaluations are reported daily. Shortages of fuel and cooking gas were reported in local markets, with petrol selling at the black market price of 750YER/litre in Al Hudaydah City. A further decline in the currency will increase inflation, weaken livelihood prospects and push more Yemenis towards destitution and further food insecurity.",

Ecuador, Panama and Venezuela, however, kept their sides of the border closed. According to Colombia\u2019s migration authorities, the opening of the border with Venezuela will be implemented gradually and follow schedules for entries and exits. Biosecurity measures have been furthermore strengthend and additional migration officials have been deployed in border areas. With these paratial border openings, UNHCR has received reports than people continue to cross through informal entry points.\n\nAmid increased violence and demonstrations related to the nationwide strike that began on 28 April, the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights is set to carry out a fact-finding mission between 7 and 11 June. Negotiations between President Duque and representatives of the National Strike Committee continue to yield no results, and new demonstrations have been announced.\n\nAs of 31 May, Colombia\u2019s migration authorities report 888,550 registrations (with username and password created) in the Single Registry for Venezuelan Migrants (RUMV in Spanish), out of which 715,176 Venezuelans have completed their pre-registration and 680,428 have finalized the profiling questionnaire, a prerequisite for finalizing the pre-registration process. A total of 563,384 Venezuelans are already scheduled for in-person biometric registration (which is scheduled to begin in August).\n\n\u25a0 According to UNHCR monitoring as of 31 May, 30,700 people (9,369 families) have been affected by 64 large-group displacement events since the start of 2021. This represents an increase of 128% compared to the same period in 2020.\n\nUNHCR monitoring as of 31 May has also reported more than 26,900 people (6,860 families) affected by confinements in five departments (Choc\u00f3, Nari\u00f1o, Antioquia, Cauca, and Valle del\n\nIn Arauca, the local Ombudsperson\u2019s office reports an estimated 6,630 people having entered via informal crossing points, of whom 5,792 returned to Venezuela. In the last week of May, approximately 400 people in transit were identified: 200 at the transport terminal and 200 walking on the road, and 827 people have been assisted in the Support Spaces throughout the department.\n\nIn La Guajira, the number of irregular entries currently varies between 200 and 300 per day, depending on the COVID-19 transportation measures being applied on the Venezuela side of the border. The majority of these movements are circular and include indigenous Wayyu.\n\nRoadblocks related to nationwide demonstrations continue to impede mobility and have severely affected livelihoods, mobility and health care throughout the country. Incidents affecting transit, including humanitarian transport of Venezuelan refugees and migrants, have been reported in Nari\u00f1o, Norte de Santander, Valle del Cauca, Cauca, Putumayo and in and around Bogot\u00e1.\n\nIn Nari\u00f1o and Putumayo, small groups of Venezuelans and Colombians have been reported both crossing into Colombia and leaving Colombia for Ecuador and Peru through irregular crossings.",

    "text": "47678\n\nExtension of health state of emergency. On 16 October, the National Assembly deliberated and adopted a resolution to extend the health state of emergency from 17 October 2020 to 10 March 2021 in an effort to\n\nbetter prevent the spread of COVID-19. This extension has been deemed necessary in light of the recent flare- ups of the disease in the Moyen-Chari and Mayo Kebbi-Ouest provinces. The adoption of the new resolution allows the government to continue pursuing the restrictive measures already in place. The Minister of Public Health and National Solidarity, Dr Abdoulaye Saber Fadoul, took the opportunity to invite the entire Chadian population to respect the barrier measures; he stressed that in order to fight this disease, the population must become aware of and observe the measures adopted by the government. In the past week, a number of new cases have been confirmed, including within the UN and NGO community, with a cluster of transmissions initially in Maro, and then Gor\u00e9, in the south. The emergence of these cases, the majority of which are asymptomatic and revealed through contact tracing and testing, has underlined the importance for all to remain extremely vigilant and active in efforts to combat the spread of the epidemic and to reinforce preventative measures.\n\nHEA study reveals impact of COVID-19 on Chadian household economics. The results of the most recent Household Economy Analysis (HEA) study on the impacts of COVID-19 in Chad - carried out between May-July 2020 - have revealed that the pandemic has brought about an increase in the number of the population in\n\nneed by 160 per cent and an increase in food needs by 155 per cent. The number of the total population facing a livelihoods protection and survival deficit has gone up from 1,122,268 to 3,015,759 people. The study covered 73 per cent of the national population (12,037,706 people analyzed). The analysis also showed that COVID-19 has had an impact on the total yearly income in the different livelihood zones. For example, the yearly income changes due to COVID-19 in the agro-pastoral zone reduced from, approximately, 940,000 to 700, 000 XAF; in the agricultural zone from 1,250,000 to 1,050,000 XAF; and in the pastoral zone from 600,000 to 400,000 XAF. HEA is a livelihoods-based framework for analyzing the way people obtain access to the things they need to survive and prosper. It consists of a baseline profile of household economics, complemented by Outcome Analyses that measure the impacts of different shocks on those household economics. The impacts are measured in relation to how households can acquire the food and cash they need to meet a Survival Deficit or Livelihoods Protection threshold. The analysis is valid through the end of the 2020 consumption year which is generally October 2020, with some variation based on livelihood practices and weather patterns.\n\nExtension and revision of curfew hours in various provinces. In the light of a new spike in COVID-19 cases and\n\nas a measure to contain this, on 20 October, the curfew established in various provinces of Chad as part of the fight against COVID-19 was extended by two weeks and the applicable hours revised. The provinces of Gu\u00e9ra, Kanem, Logone Occidental, Logone Oriental, Mayo-Kebbi Ouest, Mayo-Kebbi Est, the city of N'Djamena, Mandelia, Logone-Gana and from N'Djamena-Farah to Guitt\u00e9 are affected by this decision. Curfew hours have been revised as follows: Mayo-Kebbi-Ouest and Moyen Chari provinces: from 7:00 pm to 5:00 am; N\u2019Djamena and the other aforementioned localities: from 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.\n\nCOVID-19 update: As of 21 October, 1,410 cases and 96 deaths have been reported across 17 provinces. Over the past few weeks, there has been a flare-up of the pandemic in certain localities of the country, particularly in the South. Of the six cases reported on 21 October, four were in the southern province of Moyen-Chari, one in Mandoul, and one in N\u2019Djam\u00e9na. In light of the increase in cases over the past few weeks, the Director general",

    "text": "453\n\n\u2022 Clashes have been ongoing in Sebha city between members of the Tebu and Awlad Suleiman communities since early February 2018. Efforts to mediate between the two tribes have so far proven ineffective. \u2022 As a result of the clashes in mainly south-eastern neighbourhoods of Sebha city, there have been multiple civilian casualties (59 injuries and 13 deaths), including reportedly at least five children injured and one child killed. \u2022 The escalation of violence resulted in the reported displacement of up to 870 households to within neighbourhoods in Sebha, as well as to Ubari and Murzuq. The households who have been displaced to Al minshiyah (a neighbourhood within Sebha city), are using schools as shelter. \u2022 The main needs of the displaced population are water, non-food items (NFIs), food, hygiene items, clothing and essential medicines and medical supplies. Tents have been highlighted as the most prevalent needs for those displaced in Al minshiyah.\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)\n\nLibya | Sebha Flash Update #1\n\nSituation Overview\n\nRecurrent escalations of violence between members of the Tebu and Awlad Sulieman communities erupted early February 2018 in Sebha city and continue to date. Violence is most likely fueled further by criminal motives, such as trafficking. Efforts to mediate between the two tribes have proven ineffective and as a result divisions have grown.\n\nHeavy clashes in the city resumed on 1 March. The neighbourhoods that have been mostly affected are Tayouri (near Sebha Airport), Al Nasaria, Thanawia, Gardah and Hajara and affect the civilian population. Buildings, including homes and schools, have been destroyed as heavy weaponry is being used, and as the clashes are taking place in populated residential areas; families who live in or near these areas have displaced to Al menshiyah, Sakra, Mahdia neighbourhoods and Ubari and Murzuq.\n\nAlso as a result of the heavy clashes, multiple civilian casualties (59 injuries and 13 deaths) have been reported. There are also unconfirmed reports of snipers present in Al Nasaria, Thanawia, Gardah and Hajara neighbourhoods on top of high buildings.\n\nFurthermore, the Sebha Medical Centre (SMC \u2013 the central hospital of Sebha) was hit four times during these clashes. During two of the hits, two women were injured. The hospital has minor damage but continues to function. A mosque in the Tayouri neighbourhood was also hit and damaged, but continues to remain\n\nDiscussions to resolve the situation are ongoing, including a meeting between the SRSG Ghassan Salame and a delegation from the South, including various actors from Sebha, that took place on 12 March in Tripoli to explore ways of ending the violence and protecting civilians.\n\nHumanitarian Needs\n\nIt has been reported that due to the heavy fighting at least 59 civilians (including four women and five children) have been injured and thirteen civilians (including three females and one child) have been killed to date. Furthermore, sources have reported that between 720 \u2013 870 households have been displaced from the affected areas with the majority settling in Al menshiyah in Sebha, and mostly in schools. The remaining displaced have either moved in with their family and friends in Sakha and Mahdia or to outside of Sebha city as far as to Murzuq and Ubari. In addition to this, although numbers have yet to be verified, an estimated 950 migrants have been displaced, particularly those who work on farms or other business in the areas that have been affected. Several families are also confined to their homes as they do not want to move away for fear of not being able to return to their homes.\n\nOn 12 March, the Office of Education in Sebha, announced that the beginning of the second semester would be postponed for a week and that schools would be closed due to the clashes and also since a number of educational institutions are being used as IDP shelters.\n\nThe main needs of the displaced population are water, NFIs (particularly blankets and mattresses), food, WASH, clothing and essential medicines and medical supplies. Tents have been highlighted as the most prevalent needs for those displaced in Al menshiyah. There is also a need to provide safe and secure spaces for the migrants and refugees living in the city. Furthermore, as access to SMC has become difficult due to its proximity to the areas where clashes are taking place, safe passage is needed to allow access to the hospital for those who have been caught in the fire and mobile clinics to be located outside the city to deal with cases coming from detention centres or elsewhere with a need for urgent medical attention.

While testing for COVID-19 remains limited, Somalia\u2019s confirmed cases since the onset of the pandemic surpassed 3,000, among which more than 90 were fatal. Dessert locusts continued to consume thousands of hectares of crops in Somaliland, Puntland and Galmudug, and since the onset of the seasonal rains in April, more than 500,000 people were displaced by emergency rains and floods.\n\nAround 2.8 million persons of concern, particularly 2.6 million IDPs remain among the most vulnerable, many of whom have not recovered or restored their livelihood from the 2019 Deyr floods. UNHCR\u2019s persons of concern have appealed for enhanced cash- based support given the rise in commodity prices, including food and due to loss of wages as casual workers.\n\nDevastating consequences of floods, possible outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in IDP settlements, and infestation of desert locusts further deteriorates the living conditions of persons of concern and causes risk of new internal displacements. In July alone, the UNHCR-led Protection Return Monitoring Network recorded a staggering 158,000 new displacements in Somalia.\n\nPOPULATION OF CONCERN A total of persons of concern 2.8 million Population of concern *Internally displaced Returnees 91,828 Asylum-seekers 15,454 Refugees 14,815 * Estimated internally displaced persons as at 31 July 2018 (Source: Information Management Working Group)\n\nFUNDING (AS AT 31 JULY)\n\nUSD 154.4 million Requested for the Somalia situation\n\nwww.unhcr.org 1\n\nJULY 2020\n\nUpdate on Achievements\n\nAgainst a backdrop of ongoing insecurity, climate-related emergencies and COVID-19, UNHCR observed 158,000 new displacements in the month of July. This significant government change has not materially impacted UNHCR\u2019s persons of concern during the reporting period. As at the end of the month, UNHCR, including through its lead role in the Protection and Shelter Clusters and as co-lead to the CCCM Cluster, has continued to provide protection, assistance and durable solutions to refugees/asylum seekers, refugee returnees, internally displacement persons\n\nand mixed migrants, as indicated below. This assistance includes cash and in-kind support to persons with specific needs, psychosocial support, legal assistance, and more as outlined below.\n\nIn July, UNHCR continued providing life-saving assistance to persons of concern and hosting communities by providing protection, strengthening the national health system to contain the spread of COVID-19 and support socio- economic recovery and resilience. Through social media, television and radio, and other means of disseminating information, UNHCR and partners reached over 234,000 IDPs, returnees, refugees and asylum seekers and hosting community with life savings and hygiene/sanitation related information on COVID-19. Hygiene and sanitations materials were distributed to approximately 1,000 persons of concern in Galkayo, while approximately 500 PPEs were delivered to health facilities in Berbera and Hargeisa. While major resource gaps continue to be experienced, with the funds trickling in for COVID-19 related responses, UNHCR has scheduled the implementation of additional outstanding and critical priorities, including the following: \u2022 Support to major health facilities and isolation centres run by the government with additional medical resources, medical equipment, rehabilitation & repurposing of isolation centres, as per as part of COVID-19 Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP); \u2022 Additional support for cash assistance to the most vulnerable PoCs considering the increasing impact of COVID-19 on livelihood opportunities; \u2022 Additional support for persons with specific needs including elderly, persons with chronic illness, pregnant mothers; and \u2022 Additional support to innovative initiatives by Ministries of Education to provide alternative approaches to\n\nJULY 2020",

    "text": "38432\n\nKEY FIGURES:\n\nWEST & CENTRAL AFRICA UPDATE MAY-JUNE 2020\n\nMAIN HIGHLIGHTS Political and security developments\n\n\u25aa In West and Central Africa, the COVID-19 has put already fragile national health systems and economies under increased pressure, adding to pre-exiting challenges linked to conflict and political tensions in several parts of the region. Refugees and IDPs are particularly affected by this pandemic. Often residing in overcrowded and precarious conditions rendering impossible social distancing or basic preventive measures such as handwashing they are exposed to heightened risks of contamination. Governments have adopted measures to curb the spread of the virus including closing borders, imposing travel bans, prohibiting mass gatherings, shutting down schools, and closing markets. These restrictions had a dire impact on local economies and increased the risk of food insecurity in the region, particularly in the Sahel. With their livelihoods severely disrupted, many displaced family\u2019s resort to negative coping mechanisms, including child labour. There are also great concerns regarding gender-based violence which is on the rise since the beginning of the COVID crisis as a direct result of the preventive measures enforced and the economic strain these restrictions have put on many households. In an effort to mitigate the negative socio-economic impact of the pandemic, many countries in the region are have started to relax restrictions despite the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating in West and Africa, and moving from the main urban centers into the remote rural areas hosting the majority of refugees and IDPs.\n\n\u25aa The Sahel conflict continues to escalate and expand in the region, undisrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Burkina Faso, on 2 May 2020, anti-terrorist units entered the camp of Mentao near the city Djibo and searched several houses and injuring 30 refugees during this operation. While expressing grave concern for the safety of refugees, UNHCR assisted all injured refugees and called for an urgent investigation into the incident after which most refugees left the camp. On May 11, a joint operation was launched by Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Burkina Faso against jihadist armed groups near their shared border. This new development indicates that jihadist groups have been strengthening and expanding their range of operations, leaving coastal countries fearful that the violence may spill onto their territories. In Niger, on 30 May 2020, a coordinated attack against the Intikane refugee camp in the Tahoua region killed three refugee leaders, caused severe damages and forced thousands of persons to flee.\n\n\u25aa In effort to curb the escalating violence, the leaders from the G5 Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger) and French President Emmanuel Macron met in Nouakchott in Mauritania on 30 June, to discuss a common strategy to improve the security situation in a region while addressing the humanitarian and development crisis. Concerned with the growing number of human rights violations reported in the region, UNHCR along with other United Nations humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations issued a joint-statement on 12 June calling the G5 Sahel countries and the international forces to commit to protect civilian populations during their operations and to ensure unhindered humanitarian access.\n\n\u25aa In Chad, four refugee children lost their lives and three got injured on 24 June after manipulating an explosive device while on their way back to the Kounoungou camp where they resided, in Wadi Fira province, eastern Chad. UNHCR is responding to the needs of the affected families on site. Although this is the first case reported this year, incidents linked to mines and IEDs remain a persistent issue in the refugee hosting areas East and North of Chad.\n\nWEST & CENTRAL AFRICA UPDATE MAY-JUNE 2020\n\nInstability and violence reached unprecedented levels in May and June in the Northwestern States of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina of Nigeria where criminal groups are intensifying their attacks on villages. The security situation is also precarious in Northeast Nigeria and in the Lake Chad Basin region. On 12 June, islamists groups affiliated to Boko Haram mounted a daylight attack on Monguno town, attempting to enter the Humanitarian Hub (HH), which serves as an office and residence for UN and INGO staff in the area. At least 20 soldiers and over 40 civilians have been killed in the attack which took place a few days after at least 81 civilians were killed in the village Gubio, in the same State of Borno, With the ongoing violence by Boko Haram and other armed groups, populations continue to be forced to flee across the Lake Chad region where some 2.5 million people are currently displaced, including some 1.8 million inside Nigeria, most of them scattered in overcrowded sites where living conditions remain precarious despite international assistance. On 22 May 2020, a large fire which swept through one of the IDP sites around Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, leaving two people dead and destroying the shelters and belongings of over 4,000 displaced people. The fire began after sparks from a cooking fireplace spread out and ignited a fire which soon engulfed shelters all around the camp. In the past few months, several fire incidents have occurred in congested IDP camps across North East Nigeria where shelters are too close for safety UNHCR is working with the authorities, aid agencies and local partners to make sure those affected receive shelter and other relief items as people are once again displaced inside and outside of the camp. Many, including young children, are living under the open skies, needing immediate help with shelter, food and clothing and The Muna camp for internally displace people in Maiduguri, Nigeria, other core relief items.

    "text": "30348\n\n* WHO/PAHO as of 30 May 2020\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic spreads across the 33 countries and 15 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), the health, economic, social and political crisis it is unleashing is increasingly evident.\n\nA total of 937,974 COVID-19 cases and 49,139 deaths are reported as of 30 May across the region, surpassing Europe and the United States in daily infections and making it the new epicenter of the pandemic.\n\nThe economy is expected to decrease by 5.3 per cent- with even higher slumps in some Caribbean island countries and territories, rivaling economic contractions of the 1914 and 1930\n\nThe most affected populations include people in extreme poverty, rural populations, indigenous groups, populations on the move and informal sector workers. Women, who make up most of the informal sector labor force, are disproportionately impacted.\n\nMost governments are struggling to balance the health crisis with the economic impact of the pandemic; although some countries are easing restriction measures, most countries are extending movement restrictions and quarantines.\n\nThe expectation is that the virus will continue to spread against the backdrop of COVID-19- related corruption allegations and increasing popular discontent over these allegations and extended lockdowns, including protests.\n\nGovernments are responding with the support of humanitarian partners across the region. The needs, however, currently surpass overall response capacity.\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nLAC is struggling to cope with the rising COVID-19 cases. Medical supplies such as testing kits, Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), ventilators, oxygen, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and trained personnel are becoming scarcer. As of 30 May 2020, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO)\n\nconfirms 937,974 COVID-19 cases with approximately 49,139 deaths, making LAC the epicenter of\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.

South America, where Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Ecuador have the most cases, has over 800,000 people with COVID-19 and over 38,000 deaths. There are more than 26,300 cases in Central\n\nAmerica, while the Caribbean Islands and Territories now have over 26,000 cases with just under 900\n\nBrazil confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in LAC on 26 February and is now the country with the second highest number of COVID-19 cases after the United States; the death toll places Brazil among the top six death tolls worldwide. Although most LAC countries and territories adopted strict containment measures early on, stark infection and death increases are being reported, rising by at least 40 per cent per week.\u202fCompared to the United States (US) and Canada, LAC countries appear to have gone from first confirmed cases to the accelerated spread stage in a relatively short period of\n\nThe Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) reports that some 14 million jobs were lost during the second quarter of 2020 and that the economy will contract by over 5 per cent, something which is already being seen as export earnings (including from oil), remittances and tourism disappear. Shrinking remittances alone, which the World Bank estimates will decrease globally by about 20 per cent in 2020, will add to the diminishing livelihoods, particularly in countries where they constitute a large share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) like in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Haiti.\n\nGovernments are injecting cash into the economies and into the hand of the poorest segments of the\n\npopulation, but the sums do not match the need, particularly given that the most vulnerable are not necessarily visible through the formal markets and structures.

It will prioritise the delivery of emergency humanitarian assistance and access to comprehensive protection and durable solutions for refugees and other victims of forced displacement.\n\nSource: Data provided by governments to UNHCR to end of September 2019. Data for\n\nGiven the growing needs of the forcibly displaced, regional cooperation and responsibility-sharing is essential. UNHCR and the Organization of American States (OAS) support the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (MIRPS for its acronym in Spanish), led by seven States - Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Panama \u2013 who have made significant commitments to strengthen regional and national responses to forced displacement.\n\nI Key UNHCR achievements 2019\n\nSafeguarding fundamental rights UNHCR supported the safe spaces network, which was critical in providing immediate assistance and protection for people on the move and in identifying those with international protection needs. In 2019, thanks to UNHCR\u2019s support, 65,788 people were assisted in 10 safe spaces and 16 information points in Guatemala. Across Mexico, UNHCR assisted 50 shelters, and three new shelters were constructed. Thanks to the reception capacity of shelters operated by civil society, 8,277 asylum-seekers initially detained in Mexico were released, a practical demonstration of alternatives to detention.\n\nIn order to facilitate timely access to status determination procedures, UNHCR hired and trained over 1,300 lawyers, immigration officials and eligibility officers across the region. In Mexico, UNHCR has also supported the establishment of a protection registry area and permanent offices for the Mexican Refugee Commission (COMAR), thus facilitating and accelerating the asylum procedure.\n\nResponding with lifesaving support During 2019, UNHCR and its partners provided lifesaving assistance to displaced people, expanding its presence and reception capacity at border entry points. As an example, UNHCR established a presence in critical areas along the Mexico-Guatemala and Guatemala-Honduras border region.",

More help is needed. \u00a9IHC\n\nHelping the Sudanese people\n\nOn 4 September, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, flew 100 metric tons of relief material from our warehouse at the International Humanitarian City, Dubai. into Sudan, including 16,000 blankets, 16,000 plastic sheets against the elements and nearly 6,000 sleeping mats, funded by Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF).\n\nAs stocks of shelter material were depleting, UNHCR had called for international airlifts to help bring in more relief fast. The government of the United Arabic Emirates (UAE) swiftly donated the airlift that will speed up UNHCR\u2019s distribution of much-needed shelter material across Sudan.\n\nUNHCR, in coordination with Sudan\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) and Commissioner for Refugees (COR),\n\nis rolling out the material support which mainly goes to the local population and IDPs, but also to refugees. Flood survivors will benefit in 12 States, especially White Nile, the Kordofan States and Darfur. Combined with existing stocks, the distribution of non-food-items (NFIs) currently underway will reach some 170,000 men, women and children in the course of September - the majority of whom Sudanese families, including IDPs.\n\nThis comes after weeks of torrential rains in some parts of the country and the bursting of the banks of the Nile in Blue Nile, Sennar and Khartoum States.

Sudan declared a state of emergency for three months. Some 100 people across the country lost their lives, thousands lost their homes.\n\nAn estimated 85,000 internally displaced (IDPs) and 40,000 refugees along with thousands of their Sudanese neighbours have been affected, particularly in East Sudan, White Nile, Darfur and Khartoum, many in urgent need of shelter and other emergency assistance. Rains have been particularly heavy in North Darfur, leaving an estimated 35,000 IDPs, locals and refugees in need of help.\n\n14 refugees missing, 1 dead\n\nUNHCR assessment missions met communities in the larger Khartoum where a total of 14 South Sudanese refugees went missing after flash floods hit their houses and one little girl drowned. A boat mission reached an area at the Nile\u2019s devastated banks some 15 kilometers outside the capital where South Sudanese refugees live alongside their Sudanese neighbours. The men in the area lost their jobs as brickmakers in the aftermath of the disastrous events. Hygiene levels have plummeted following the collapse of latrines during the flooding which left people no other choice than open defecation. One home out of thousands damaged by heavy rains in West Kordofan. \u00a9UNHCR/Mohammed Elhaj The mission learned from community leaders about the tragic disappearance of eight refugees. The six adults and two children were sleeping when the powerful flash floods from the river reached their homes, and they were never seen again. The muddy waters made 100 other refugees and their Sudanese neighbours homeless in the area. The refugees request to be given a dry and safe piece of land to move away from the riverbank.

This vessel, will operate in addition to the VOS Apollo vessel serving Aden, was chartered to address the increasing humanitarian needs in Yemen, and thus allowing for the timely and effective response of humanitarian organisations. In addition, the vessel will strengthen the marine evacuation assets in line with HCT policy to ensure staff safety and security. VOS Theia is expected to start operating on 15 March, it will carry both humanitarian cargo and passengers. The Logistics Cluster will facilitate access to the service for humanitarian organisations. On 26 February, MT Celesta carrying 5 million litres of diesel procured by WFP berthed in Hodeidah; discharging of the diesel was completed the following day. In addition, WFP is procuring 1.5 million litres of diesel in Aden. The Logistics Cluster will disburse this fuel to humanitarian organisations on a cost-recovery basis, to keep critical infrastructure (e.g. water and sanitation systems and hospital generators) working in major cities across Yemen, as well as to allow day-to-day operations of humanitarian organisations. Distributions are expected to being in the first week of March, once custom clearance is completed.\n\nIn February, the Logistics Cluster facilitated two airlifts from Djibouti to Sana\u2019a. o The first airlift was composed of two rotations on 13 and 14 February, carrying overall 41.6 mt/232 m3 mt of cargo on behalf of OCHA, UNFPA and WHO. o The second airlift was carried out in one rotation on 26 February, transporting 3 mt/23.6 m3 of relief items on behalf of OCHA, UNICEF and IOM. A tentative schedule for airlifts in 2018 is available on the Logistics Cluster website at the following link: \uf0b7 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on how to access Air Transport service, as well as a recap snapshot, are available on the Logistics Cluster website.\n\nFollowing some disruptions to the VOS Apollo service at the end of January, due to the unstable security situation, the vessel resumed and maintained normal voyages throughout February, while a second vessel, Aladin, remained on stand-by off the coast of Aden, as a precautionary measure in case of staff downsizing. In coordination with UNDSS, it was decided to not extend the Aladin beyond 28 February, and the vessel consequently departed. In February, the VOS Apollo carried out four voyages between Djibouti and Aden, transporting 74 passengers on behalf of 12 organisations, for an average use rate of 37 percent. \uf0b7 SOPs specifying booking and cancellation procedures, are available on the Logistics Cluster website at: All booking requests, cancellations and inquiries have to be submitted to co_yem_passenger@wfp.org\n\nLOGISTICS CLUSTER - YEMEN Situation Update February 2018\n\nIn February, the Logistics Cluster facilitated the transport of 23 mt/167 m3 of relief items on behalf of IOM, MSF and WHO on board the VOS Apollo. \uf0b7 In addition, the Logistics Cluster facilitated the loading of a dhow with 59.3 mt/264.3 m3 of medical items on behalf of WHO. The dhow left Djibouti on 27 February, and arrived in Hodeidah on 1 March. A reefer container and a container for temperature-controlled items are available on the VOS Apollo. Other containers can be accepted on board, as the vessel has a capacity of 600 mt equivalent to 36 x 20\u2019 containers. \uf0b7 SOPs to access the Sea Transport service, as well as a recap snapshot, are available on the Logistics Cluster website. \uf0b7 A tentative schedule for cargo transport on the VOS Apollo throughout 2018 has been published at: A tentative schedule for monthly dhow transport to all accessible ports in Yemen is available at:\n\nIn February, the Logistics Cluster facilitated road transport of 474.5 mt/1,068 m3 of relief items on behalf of 9 organisations (ACF, ADRA, FAO, Islamic Relief, Save the Children, UNDP, UNICEF, UNOPS, WFP). \uf0b7 The Logistics Cluster can obtain security clearances on behalf of humanitarian organisations using the overland transport service facilitated by the cluster. Organisations not using cluster-facilitated transport services need to request clearances directly to the Ministry of Interiors. \uf0b7 The Logistics Cluster can make available refrigerated trucks upon request. The Logistics Cluster through WFP will make available a dedicated fleet of 25 trucks across Sana\u2019a, Aden and Hodeidah to increase the overland transport capacity as of the first week of March. SOPs to access the service are available at the on the Logistics Cluster website.",

Kindly note: the next Situation Report will be released on 10 May and, thereafter, Situation Reports will be released on a weekly basis, with an expanded scope to capture the impact of the Tripoli clashes on the humanitarian situation throughout Libya.\n\n\u2022 Ramadan commences with continued conflict despite the UN\u2019s call for a humanitarian truce, with civilians trapped in conflict areas unable to move to safety and humanitarian actors\u2019 access to those in need restricted. \u2022 DTM-IOM rapid assessment highlights the vulnerabilities of refugees and migrants in conflict-affected urban settings.\n\npeople internally displaced by ongoing hostilities\n\ncivilian casualties confirmed, including 23 civilian fatalities\n\npeople assisted with some form of humanitarian assistance since the onset of crisis\n\nfunding required for Tripoli Flash Appeal\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nCountry Emergency Situation Report No. 22 | 2\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\n\u2022 Hostilities have continued along established frontlines, despite UNSMIL calls for a humanitarian truce to coincide with the start of the holy month of Ramadan. Airstrikes, rocket/shelling attacks and armed clashes have taken place against various military positions in and around Tripoli at the same intensity as previous days, with no significant gains for either side. In the absence of a humanitarian truce, civilians trapped in conflict areas remain unable to move freely to safer areas and humanitarian actors\u2019 access to those in need remains restricted. On 5 May, UNSMIL called on all parties to observe a one-week, extendable truce to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need and to provide for the freedom of movement of civilians. On the same day, LNA commander Khalifa Haftar issued a statement calling on his forces to redouble their efforts in fighting during Ramadan.\n\n\u2022 To date, 104 civilian casualties have been verified by the Health Sector, including 23 civilian deaths1. These include four health workers killed, with one other doctor injured, since hostilities commenced.\n\n\u2022 On 6 May, DTM-IOM released a summary of findings from a recent rapid assessment of the impact of armed conflict on the situation of refugees and migrants in urban settings in the conflict-affected areas of Aubsliem, Ain Zara, Khallat Al Furjan, Salah Eddin, Hai Andalus, Qasr Bin Ghasheer, Suq Al Jumaa, Tajoura, Janzour, Swani Bin Adam and Tripoli Centre.2 Similarly to Libyan households, those refugees and migrants in areas closest to frontline fighting are the most adversely impacted. Freedom of movement was found to be partially or completely restricted in most of the areas assessed due to proximity to armed conflict, limiting the ability of refugees and migrants to move freely, or to be evacuated, to safer areas. Refugees and migrants relying on daily wage labour find a lack of available jobs, as well as a lack of access to markets and food. Facing the same insecurities as conflict-affected Libyans, refugees and migrants are especially vulnerable as they lack similar extended family/social networks on whom to rely for shelter/support in times of crisis and face discrimination in accessing collective shelters and other services. Some 168,000 urban refugees and migrants were estimated to be residing in the assessed areas prior to the crisis. Nearly 3,500 refugees and migrants also remain trapped in detention centres exposed to or at risk of armed conflict. According to protection partners, some urban refugees and migrants have requested to be taken into detention due to the lack of available shelter and services.\n\nThese figures include only cases that could be individually verified, and so must be considered a minimum.

The official death toll is 56, but, given the number of people still missing, the number of fatalities is expected to rise. Recovery teams face major challenges as they work to access hard-to-reach, isolated areas where widely dispersed groups of transient and largely undocumented people had lived before the storm. Across the Bahamas, the hurricane caused about $7 billion in property damage.\n\nIn the past week, Prime Minister of the Bahamas Hubert Minnis announced the formation of a new government agency, the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness, Management and Reconstruction, which will lead Hurricane Dorian recovery and development efforts, as well as future disaster responses in the country. Prime Minister Minnis also addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Friday, September 27, describing Hurricane Dorian as a \u201cgenerational tragedy\u201d and called on world leaders to take urgent action to combat the global climate crisis.\n\nThough normal commercial flights are slowly resuming, the main airport terminal on Grand Bahama is destroyed, forcing passengers flying out of the airport to wait for their flights in tents. Roads are littered with debris and downed trees, and Bahamians are continuing work on what is left of their homes.\n\nThe Grand Bahama Power Company has restored power to Freeport\u2019s Rand Memorial Hospital, which has been operating at limited capacity since the storm hit. Health workers at the Rand Memorial Hospital have noted a number of concerns they face in the coming weeks and months, including immediate needs for:\n\ncommunity mobilization to address key health and hygiene challenges at damaged health facilities and their catchment communities;\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nHurricane Dorian Situation Report #12 September 30, 2019\n\nmental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), given an anticipated rise in need from the wider population as the shock of the destruction begins to fade, and many have lost homes and loved ones; and\n\nrestoration of water, sanitation and hygiene services health facilities (for example, the 8 Mile Rock clinic has a reservoir but cannot get the water into the facility).\n\nINTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CORPS RESPONSE\n\nWorking with the Grand Bahama Public Health Authority (PHA), International Medical Corps is expanding and reconfiguring its response to meet the island\u2019s medical and healthcare needs. Our teams of doctors and nurses continue to see patients at the emergency primary healthcare clinic we have set up at High Rock, while mobile medical teams working from High Rock continue to conduct visits to more isolated communities, such as Pelican Point and McCleans Town, where all pre-existing healthcare capacity has been destroyed.\n\nIn Freeport, the island\u2019s main city, we are continuing to support a maternity clinic serving public healthcare patients temporarily housed at the privately-owned Sunrise Medical Center. Some of our medical volunteers have provided labor, delivery and postpartum care to patients, while one volunteer nurse has assisted the local nurses and doctors at the Special Care Unit, where premature babies need regular feedings and antibiotics.\n\nOur volunteers also are continuing to support existing, but short-staffed, clinics west of the capital in the towns of Eight Mile Rock and Hawksbill. And, as recovery continues, we focusing on long-term recovery by training local service providers and community health workers and volunteers to undertake standard health education and surveillance of disease outbreaks.\n\nEoin Ryan, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) adviser for International Medical Corps, briefs representatives from USAID\u2019s Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) at the High Rock clinic.\n\nA new technical advisor for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) arrived on Thursday. He visited the High Rock Clinic and worked on setting up handwashing facilities in the areas where our health workers are conducting patient treatments. Water-quality monitoring will be conducted in upcoming weeks and will include two tests: a microbiological test for water samples from all water sources and water tankers that International Medical Corps uses, conducted on a monthly basis; and a free residual chlorine test, which will be conducted on a daily basis by the WASH monitors. In other areas, water testing will be increased where perceived threats of outbreaks exist.",

FGD participants reported coming to Banki due to its proximity to their AoO. They also perceived higher levels of safety and better access to aid in Banki than in their AoO. Returnees from Cameroon explained during the FGDs that they returned to Nigeria willingly due to the fear of imprisonment for lacking identity documentation.

    "text": "40327\n\nWFP ROHINGYA REFUGEE RESPONSE\n\nTHREE YEARS INTO THE CRISIS\n\nAugust 25, 2020 marked the third year of WFP providing life-saving assistance to support the refugee and host populations in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh. However, the need for continued assistance remains dire with 94% of Rohingya refugees assessed as vulnerable* even before the COVID-19 pandemic, which has further exacerbated the crisis.\n\n25 August 2020 marked three years since the mass exodus of Rohingya refugees to Cox\u2019s Bazar in August 2017. Over 745,000 fled persecution in Myanmar, including more than 400,000 children. Since the start of the crisis, WFP has rapidly responded to the influx, providing food and nutrition access to over a mil- lion refugees in the camps and Bangladeshis in the host communities, alongside facilitating essential shared services. Cox\u2019s Bazar is one of the poorest and most disaster-prone districts of Bangladesh. The COVID-19 crisis has further heightened vulnerabilities in the impoverished and underdeveloped areas for\n\nboth the Rohingya refugees and the host community, who continue to bear the environmental and socio- economic impact of the influx.\n\nThree years into the crisis, WFP remains committed\n\nto meeting the critical needs of the refugees and the\n\nlocal community that has generously hosted them. Much progress has been achieved by the humanitarian community in Cox\u2019s Bazar since the arrival of Rohingya in 2017, but the need for continued assistance remains high. In 2019, 94\n\npercent of the refugee population was highly or\n\nmoderately vulnerable and dependent on donor-\n\nfunded support, an increase from 88 percent in 2018 and 80 percent in 2017 (REVA III, 2019). WFP depends on the generous support of donors to deliver to these vulnerable people who most need it.\n\n* Refugee influx Emergency Vulnerability Assessment (REVA) III Report, April 2020.\n\nSeptember 2020\n\nYEAR IN REVIEW KEY ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2019 - 2020\n\nGeneral Food Assistance\n\nWFP provides general food assistance to the entire refugee pop- ulation through a combination of in-kind and e-voucher modali- ties using innovative data systems such as Building Blocks based on blockchain technology, introduced in March 2020, and SCOPE.\n\n800,000+ total e-voucher beneficiaries\n\n370,000+ beneficiaries transferred from in-kind to e-voucher in the last year\n\n60% of refugee population served by Building Blocks in 10 of 17 e-voucher outlets\n\nCOVID Response\n\nSince late March, WFP has adapted its programmes to adhere to government restrictions, limit movement into and within the camps, and target the most vulnerable population in Cox\u2019s Bazar during the pandemic.\n\n500,000+ people\n\nsupported in host (cash & in-kind)\n\nJoint Distribution\n\nof nutrition and school feeding items at food distribution sites\n\n7 security check points\n\ninto camps manned by WFP through Humanitarian Access Project\n\n250,000+ masks made by beneficiaries\n\nSelf-Reliance / Livelihoods\n\nSchool Feeding\n\nWFP successfully integrated all preven- tion and treatment services with UNICEF and UNHCR, enhancing refugees\u2019 access to essential nutrition services through improved inter-agency collaboration. 45 integrated 184,000 children nutrition sites in under 5 assisted the camps 106 community 30,000 pregnant clinics in the host and nursing mother community, up from 86 the previous year\n\n31,800+ Rohingya engaged in self-reliance activities since August 2019, up from 6,620 the previous year Activities include trainings in tailoring, embroidery, mobile phone servicing, solar repairing, sanitary nap- kin/mask production, homestead gardening, and aquaculture, and a recycling project.\n\nDisaster Risk Reduction 70 cyclone shelters rehabilitated in host WFP engaged 33,751 cash-for-work partici- pants in the host community and camps in rehabilitation works, such as road construc- 4,930 m of drains constructed tion, drainage clearance and reforestation. 2,250 acres (host community) and 290 3,945 m of acres (camps) were reforested, including pathways constructed the planting of 294,600 trees in the camps.",

The number of acutely hungry people in the world could increase\n\nby more than 100 million this year, according to WFP estimates. For particularly fragile countries, a slide towards famine is a real risk.\n\n\u201c\u2018The world produces enough food for everyone so it\u2019s a problem not of scarcity but of access to nutritious and affordable food,\u201d said WFP Executive Director David Beasley, \u201cSmallholder farmers in developing nations need support so they can grow crops in a more sustainable way, then store and transport their produce to markets, and ultimately improve their own livelihoods. When food moves from the farm, along the supply chain and onto people\u2019s plates in a fair and efficient way, then everyone benefits.\u201d\n\nWFP, which last week won the Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to fight hunger, has unparalleled experience in buying and distributing food. Every year, WFP increases the\n\namount of food it procures locally from smallholder farmers, providing training in post- harvest storage and in how to access markets. The aim is to build dynamic food systems\n\nwhich contribute to community-based agricultural growth and the strengthening of national\n\nThe need for concerted action to improve agricultural production while enhancing global supply chains and ending food waste is captured in this year\u2019s World Food Day theme: \u201cGrow, Nourish, Sustain. Together\u201d. The three Rome-based agencies - WFP, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) \u2013 are calling for sustainable investment in food systems to achieve healthy diets for all. Without massive improvements in the food supply chain, many fragile nations are set to become increasingly vulnerable to financial volatility and climate shocks.\n\nVia Cesare Giulio Viola 68/70, 00148 Rome, Italy | T +39 06 65131 F +39 06 6590 632/7\n\nIn Sudan, food insecurity remains alarmingly high with some 9.6 million people estimated to be food insecure. This is the highest figure ever recorded in Sudan. Sudan has also witnessed\n\nhistoric flooding in recent months that has devasted homes, destroyed vast swaths of farmlands and crops, and affected more than 875,000 people.\n\nThe economic crisis and inflation are also posing challenges to food security in Sudan. The average price of the local food basket has increased by nearly 200 per cent compared to 2019, making it even harder for families to put food on their plates.\n\n\u201cCombined, these multiple crises can further increase food insecurity and risk pushing millions of people into poverty. But if we take concerted action now, we can build a future we want \u2013 a world free of hunger. We remain committed to working with all our partners in Sudan, including the Government, to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030,\u201d said WFP Representative and Country Director in Sudan Dr. Hameed Nuru.\n\nNo one government or organisation can achieve these goals alone. More than ever, there is a need for global solidarity to help all people, and especially the most vulnerable, to confront the crises facing the planet \u2013 multiple conflicts, climate change and COVID-19.\n\nThe United Nations World Food Programme is the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. We are the world\u2019s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.",

    "text": "2889\n\n11 - 18 May 2018\n\nUNHCR FLASH UPDATE\n\nOn 16 May, UNHCR evacuated 135 persons of concern (36 men, 63 women and 36 children) from Tripoli to UNHCR\u2019s Emergency Transit Mechanism (ETM) in Niger. This is the second flight to Niamey following the resumption of the humanitarian evacuation program. As of 16 May, UNHCR has evacuated 1,609 individuals out of Libya (1,287 to the ETM, 312 to Italy and 10 to Romania) and submitted 465 cases for resettlement to third countries.\n\nOn 15 May, UNHCR conducted an inter-agency mission to Sirte (455 km East of Tripoli) with OCHA, UNICEF and IOM. This was the first mission of international staff to the city by land. The team met with the mayor of the city and civil society organizations to discuss future collaboration to support displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees in the area and their most urgent needs. Healthcare was highlighted by the authorities as a pressing need. The Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) reports that a total of 13,893 IDPs and 72,960 returnees are currently living in Sirte.\n\nOn 14 May, UNHCR airlifted a second group of 86 persons in need of international protection from Zwara (102 km west of Tripoli) to Tripoli. The group included 79 men and seven women from Eritrean, Ethiopia and Somalia. They will remain in a detention facility until they can be evacuated by UNHCR under its humanitarian evacuation programme.\n\nPopulations Movements\n\nAs of 15 May, 6,551 refugees and migrants were disembarked in Libya by the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG). During the week, 211 individuals (168 men, 34 women and nine children) were disembarked at the Tripoli Naval Base. The majority of those disembarked were Eritrean. Following recent trends, the boats departed from Al Khums (120 km East of Tripoli) and Zwara (118 Km West of Tripoli). UNHCR and its partner, International Medical Corps (IMC) provided urgent medical and humanitarian assistance at the disembarkation points and at the detention centres where they were then transferred by the authorities.\n\nUNHCR Response\n\nOn 13 and 14 May, UNHCR and its partner LibAid distributed NFIs to 754 displaced Tawerghan families (4,525 individuals) living in settlements in Ajdabya and Benghazi. One of the distributions took place in Al Haleys settlement, the largest IDP Tawerghan settlement in Benghazi, hosting 1,317 individuals. UNHCR provided humanitarian assistance (including kitchen sets, sleeping mats, solar lamps, blankets, plastic sheets, diapers, jerry cans, hygiene and sanitary kits) to 1,900 families who have been displaced in the south of Libya as a result of ongoing clashes. The families are living in private and public buildings in Sabha and Marzuq. UNHCR continues to respond to the needs of displaced families in Libya, where so far 16,810 IDPs received NFIs in 2018.\n\nWith the support of European Union funding, a three day capacity-building workshop on refugee and IDP protection took place in Tripoli from 14 to 16 May. Participants included 30 female staff working in the Ministry of Interior.\n\nUNHCR is following-up on the situation of refugees and migrants in Gharyan detention centre, following reports of disappearances from the detention centre. UNHCR has supported the transfer of 600 refugees and migrants from Gharyan and Azizia to Tripoli, with a view to ensure they remain in a safer location, and has provided material, medical and psychosocial support to transferred\n\nKey Figures people of concern 52,031 registered refugees & asylum-seekers 184,612* internally displaced persons\n\nUNHCR Coordinated Sectors\n\nShelter & NFI Sector Cash & Markets Working Group\n\nKey Achievements in 2018\n\n17,854 35,091 in 2017) 27,759 IDPs and refugees received non-food items (113,605 in 2017) 2,775 IDP and refugee households received cash assistance (3,314 in 2017) 15,569 individuals registered since 2016 (7,408 in 2018) 4,350 rescue kits and 633 medical\n\n(5,327 and 2,956 in 2017)\n\n520 monitoring visits to (1,080 in 2017)\n\n1,273 detained refugees/asylum-seekers released (1,428 in 2017)",

However, better integrated, centrally located market-hubs such as Chattogram have clearly been less impacted by rising prices of staples such as rice and lentils as compared to markets in Cox\u2019s Bazar. \u2022 Rice prices forecasted to remain high owing to Aus1 and Aman1 crop losses due to the recent floods and heavy monsoon. Bumper harvest during the Boro season however expected to cover demand for rice reserve. \u2022 Overall, all markets within Cox\u2019s Bazar district are running at approximately 50 percent functionality on average, with Ukhia faring marginally better than others for providing with more variety of product choice and having better stock compared to others. \u2022 Supply chain functionality in terms of responsiveness and availability of goods is high but low assortment of goods and high price volatility scores across the region has lowered overall market functionality. \u2022 Five out of ten traders reported that consumers are buying less goods than usual, where two out of ten traders said that customers are asking to buy on credit, highlighting continued strains on purchasing power and consumer demand. \u2022 In camp markets, slight increase in purchasing power with the partial reopening of economy had positive impact on reduced credit purchase. \u2022 The widespread decrease in sales volume has not affected business sustenance for majority of traders (72 percent) in the region as adversely but tax relief and loan disbursement have emerged as perceivably the most needed policy support mechanisms for the remaining (28 percent) vulnerable trader community.\n\nFood Price Trends\n\nPage | 1\n\nPage | 2\n\nAlthough the bumper harvest of Boro rice this season replenished the food reserve for Bangladesh up to November ensuring adequate rice supply to markets, traders forecast that rice prices are unlikely to decrease up to the next harvest season December due to Aus and Aman crop losses due to the floods and monsoon. Government initiatives to purchase rice at higher prices to ensure rice reserve for safety nets have resulted in farmers\u2019 and millers\u2019 inclination to stock and sell to government, driving up market prices as a result. Lockdowns in Myanmar and heavy monsoon in India are obstructing supply of commodities such as onions but with port activities restarting, import supply chains are expected to normalize through alternative channels. Govt initiatives have reportedly benefitted market functionality, but limited to large, creditworthy traders. Small traders report not receiving benefits of policy support such as interest rate reductions from banks.\n\nCamp markets are fully functional continuing from mid- July, 2020. Purchasing power improved slightly and credit purchase decreased due to partial reopening of economy.

On the other hand, price of chicken is decreasing and stabilizing.

Wearing of mask has increased in the camps and the e- voucher shops, which provided the refugees with increased sense of safety.\n\nMarkets are functioning well for availability and supply chain responsiveness, but the overall performance is diminished between 50 percent of functionality due to the lower assortment of goods and higher price volatility.

Further escalation was observed in 2020 and spilled over in 2021, with a greater toll on human lives and on vulnerable populations.\n\nAs of March 2021, over 1.14 million people have been displaced and new displacements are reported on a daily basis. The unprecedented humanitarian emergency has left over 3.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance \u2013 according to the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan. Health services, schools and markets have been closed due to growing insecurity in several parts of the country, seriously affecting the population\u2019s ability to sustain their livelihoods and healthy living standards. Across the country, over 300 health centres are closed or operate at a minimum, depriving 822,000 people of access to services; over 2,200 schools have closed, affecting 316,000 children having lost access to education. COVID-19 and its impact on market dynamics and\n\ndisplacement and floods severely affected agricultural productivity in specific areas of the country affected by the volatile security situation. In\n\nthese areas, a decline in agricultural production of between 20 and 50\n\npercent was observed compared to previous years. This led to the early depletion of household stocks, increasing the dependence of internally displaced populations (IDPs) and host populations on markets and\n\nhumanitarian assistance. While cereal production at national level is\n\nexpected at 16 percent above average (5-year period), some provinces in the northern and eastern regions of the country face production deficits from 19 to 38 percent compared to their usual production rates,\n\nas households have less access to fields due to insecurity and the\n\ndisplacement of populations.

    "text": "50800\n\nBriefing note 08 February 2021\n\nOn 15 January, armed clashes broke out between members of Arab and Masalit tribes in and around Ag Geneina, West Darfur\u2019s state capital. Attacks on three Krinding IDP camps and other areas on the outskirts of Ag Geneina resulted in the displacement of 108,800 people to Ag Geneina town and surrounding villages. 65,800 displaced people are sheltering in 52 centres across Ag Geneina town. The violence has killed 400 people and injured over 470 (WFP 29/01/2021; DTM 01/02/2021; 03/02/2021). The overall security situation in Ag Geneina remains calm, but tensions are high and protests continue to cut off access and supply routes to the town (OCHA 03/02/2021).\n\nThe intercommunal violence, which was sparked by the fatal stabbings of two men in a local market, escalated into widespread fighting involving armed militias and continued for three days (OCHA 20/01/2021; Al Jazeera 17/01/2021). Intercommunal tensions between Arab and non-Arab groups have resulted in violent clashes and population displacements in West Darfur since 2017, with incidents increasing towards the end of 2020 (Reuters 01/01/2020; OCHA\n\nDisplaced people are sheltering in schools and other public buildings across Ag Geneina and in surrounding villages. Protection, shelter and non-food\n\nOn 18 January, violent clashes between Fallata and Rizeigat tribes displaced 19,300 people in South Darfur. The situation has stabilised since 25 January with the deployment of security forces in the area (OCHA 28/01/2021). Attacks by armed militia in Jebel Marra, North Darfur, between 24\u201331 January displaced a further 22,000 people (OCHA 04/02/2021). These separate incidents of violence in Darfur raise concerns about the imminent risk of further violence in the region (OHCHR 22/01/2021).\n\ntensions remain high and protests are ongoing (OCHA 20/01/2021; DTM 25/01/2021; OCHA 31/01/2021). The current security situation is too unstable for safe IDP returns. The destruction of 90% of homes in the Krinding camps during the violence also impedes returns (OCHA 31/01/2021; Save the Children 21/01/2021).\n\n\u2022 Attacks on civilians in areas around Ag Geneina continue and protection is a key concern (UNFPA 30/01/2021). High tensions, impunity, and gaps in protection by state authorities present risks of further violence across Darfur, as witnessed in South Darfur (OHCHR 22/01/2021). Any questions? Please contact info@acaps.org\n\nThe violence has resulted in the deaths of three aid workers (OCHA 20/01/2021). Since 18 January the violence has subsided, improving security conditions for humanitarian actors. The situation is still volatile however, and some organisations are conducting needs assessments remotely because of security concerns (ABC News 18/01/2021; DTM 20/01/2021; UNFPA 19/01/2021).\n\nThere are reports of continued attacks on civilians in areas around Ag Geneina. People in affected areas fear that local forces are not able to provide protection. Women and girls have reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence during and after displacement (UNFPA 30/01/2021).\n\n65,800 IDPs are sheltering in 52 public buildings, including schools, while the remaining 43,000 are staying in open areas (DTM 01/02/2021). They are in urgent need of NFIs including sleeping mats, blankets, mosquito nets, kitchen equipment, and\n\ndignity kits for women and girls. Humanitarian actors are advocating for funds to fill\n\ngaps and meet basic NFI needs (DTM 20/01/2021; OCHA 20/01/2021; OCHA 18/01/2021).\n\nIDPs will require materials and support to facilitate returns when the security situation allows, as there are reports of widespread property destruction in camps (ABC News 18/01/2021; UNFPA 19/01/2021; Save the Children 21/01/2021).\n\nThe Humanitarian Aid Commission and UN agencies previously identified WASH as a priority need for IDPs in Ag Geneina. Newly displaced people lack access to WASH facilities in the temporary shelters (OCHA 20/01/2021; UNFPA 30/01/2021).\n\nDisplaced people require emergency food assistance, which the WFP has said it can provide. Prices of fresh food have increased because of a lack of availability caused by shop closures and blocked supply routes (OCHA 20/01/2021; OCHA 28/01/2021).",

Health sector partners have also delivered emergency medical supplies to the main health facilities in the affected areas supported by mobile medical teams. A substantial\n\nportion of the assistance is delivered under the inter-agency Rapid Response Mechanism, which has also pre- positioned humanitarian supplies in Sebha for a timely and efficient response in case of further need. UNFPA plans to assess the protection needs of affected women.\n\nIn Benghazi, as part of coping mechanism, some 52 assessed displaced families reported reducing their expenditure on essential non-food items such as water, hygiene items and expenses on health, medicine or\n\neducation. This was followed by 42 families reporting that they are borrowing money as means to cope with their daily expenditures, for example purchasing food on debt to sustain everyday living. In addition, most families reported that children were at high risk and in need of psycho-social assistance. Most households that have left Murzuq have faced a number of violations to their rights, safety and dignity.2\n\nThe sector and its partners continue to coordinate health response with health local authorities including the Murzuq Crisis Committee, Sabha Municipality Council and Sabha Medical Center and others at different levels to cover any emerging needs.\n\nThe Health Sector provided medical equipment and different health kits including trauma, non-communicable and cholera.

    "text": "67831\n\nNORTH-EAST NIGERIA: Flash Update #1 Cholera outbreak and AWD cases in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (BAY) states\n\nAs 3 September 2021\n\nMore than 2,000 cholera and acute watery diarrhea (AWD) cases, including 76 fatalities were reported in 25 local government areas (LGAs) across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (BAY) states over the last two months. It is the first time in three years that BAY states are simultaneously hit by cholera outbreaks. The registered cases is likely a significant\n\nOn 31 August, the Borno State Government declared an outbreak of cholera during a press conference, with Adamawa State Government declaring an outbreak earlier in August. As of 3 September, there are 666 cases in Borno State with 45 deaths; 124 cases in Adamawa State with 5 deaths; Yobe State reporting an estimated 1,300 AWD cases, the highest reported in all three states, including 26 deaths as reported by the Yobe State Ministry of Health.\n\nGovernment and partners in the three states have activated emergency response mechanisms, including the establishment of cholera treatment facilities and deployment of emergency teams and vital supplies to affected areas. It is noted that there is limitation in the state and federal capacities for sampling, assessment. Importation of critical inputs to the cholera response has also proved difficult. Both these factors may impede a timely response and efforts to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nSome of the worst affected locations are hard-to-reach areas, impacting the prompt delivery of vital supplies and access for medical teams. Over 3.5 million litres of chlorinated water were supplied to affected and vulnerable households; more than 500,000 people were reached with hygiene promotion and risk awareness programmes, focused on prevention and control of diarrheal diseases.\n\nSome of the worst-affected locations have already run out of vital supplies. Import restrictions have resulted in shortages related to urgently needed Ringer Lactate solution critical for cholera treatment.\n\nSituation Overview More than 2,000 of cases of cholera and acute watery diarrhea (AWD) have been reported in 25 local government areas (LGAs) across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (BAY) states in north-east Nigeria as of 1 September 2021. These reported cases include 75 associated deaths. The onset of the rainy season, marked by multiple flash flooding incidents that contaminated several water sources, have increased the risk of water-borne disease outbreaks especially AWD and cholera in the region. Limited health and water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH) facilities, further weakened by 12 years of conflict, poor hygiene practices, especially open defecation and\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)\n\ncongestion - across camps and communities hosting displaced and affected populations - are among the risk factors that have contributed to the rapid spread of these diseases across these three states.\n\nThe cholera outbreak in Borno is particularly concerning as 75 per cent of the total 666 reported cases and 68 per cent of total 45 fatalities (as of 1 September) are clustered in Gwoza and Damboa LGAs. These are currently hard-to-reach locations due to ongoing insecurity, where WASH facilities and health systems are particularly weak. Over 300,000 civilians in Damboa LGA are currently facing acute shortages of clean water, while complicated/critical health cases are being referred to neighbouring LGAs (between 60 to 90 kilometers away) due to the absence of secondary health care facilities or services in the LGA. Gwoza LGA, is facing a similar situation of acute water shortages and major health service gaps since July when the only aid agency providing secondary health care services suspended operations. Poor hygiene facilities combined with overcrowding, especially across camps and host communities, is still a major risk factor for rapid spread being reported in the two LGAs.\n\nAdamawa State currently has some 124 cholera cases and 5 fatalities across six LGAs, including the capital city of Yola. A spike in cases, reaching 50 in mid-August, prompted the declaration of a cholera outbreak by the Government to activate a response. Although new cases marginally dropped towards the end of August, heavy rainfall and flooding incidents affecting some 15 LGAs in recent days could potentially trigger a surge in new cases. This has temporary displaced people and contaminated of water sources in affected communities.",

    "text": "35858\n\nUnited Nations Nations Unies Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs UNDER-SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS AND EMERGENCY RELIEF COORDINATOR, MARK LOWCOCK Briefing to the Security Council on the humanitarian situation in Syria\n\nNew York, 29 July 2020\n\nAs delivered\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I will focus today on four main areas: First, the support humanitarian agencies are delivering to people across Syria. Second, the economic situation and its humanitarian consequences. Third, protection of civilians. And fourth, funding for the humanitarian operation. Mr. President, Humanitarian aid operations across Syria are reaching an average of 6.8 million people each The economic crisis, which I will come on to, is deepening poverty and pushing more people into humanitarian need. 4.6 million people are receiving monthly food assistance; more than 8.9 million medical procedures have been conducted; and more than 1.6 million children have received help with their education. With the Security Council\u2019s decision, on 11 July, to extend authorization for UN cross-border aid delivery into north-west Syria, we are working to address the operational challenges arising from your decision.\n\nThe UN is also helping tackle COVID-19 in Syria. The problem is now country-wide: cases have now been confirmed in all but one of Syria\u2019s governorates. UN staff working in Syria are also struck by the disease.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases remains in the hundreds \u2013 so still a relatively low level. The true number of cases is certainly higher; limited testing capacity, compared to what is available in neighbouring countries, and a reluctance, among some people, to acknowledge an infection masks the real scale of the outbreak.\n\nMr. President, my second point today is the impact of the economic downturn.\n\nThe Syrian economy, devastated by nearly a decade of conflict, has entered a period of extreme fragility, marked by exchange rate volatility, high inflation, dwindling remittances, and lock down measures to contain COVID-19. For the year as a whole, the economy is expected to contract by more than 7 per cent this year.\n\nInitial estimates suggest that job losses in recent months have increased unemployment from 42 per cent last year to close to 50 per cent today.\n\nRemittances from abroad, a lifeline on which many Syrians depend, have fallen. Estimated remittances from Gulf States alone are now $2 million per day, down from $4.4 million in 2017, and at least $7 million in 2010.\n\nAfter falling to its lowest recorded informal rate in June, at 3,200 Syrian Pounds to the US dollar, the Pound has been regaining value. But this has so far not translated into price reductions for basic commodities and the cost of them continues to rise.\n\nMarket monitoring by the World Food Programme recorded a 48 per cent increase in the average price of a standard reference food basket between May and June. Food prices are 240 per cent higher than in June last year.\n\nWhat this means is that families across the country can no longer afford the very basics. And food security and nutrition indicators clearly reflect that.\n\nSome 9.3 million people are food insecure. More than 2 million more are at risk of becoming food insecure. 86 per cent of households say they are buying lower quality food, or less food, or skipping meals.\n\nIn some parts of the country, recent surveillance data show that chronic malnutrition among children under five is now at 29 per cent, compared to 19 per cent around this time last year. Mr. President, my third point is on the obligation to respect and protect civilians.\n\nThe ceasefire reached in March in the north-west between the Russian Federation and Turkey is largely holding, but some air and ground-based strikes have been reported in recent weeks.\n\nThe Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights recorded at least five civilian deaths, including two children, and 26 civilians, including seven children, injured as a result of shelling and airstrikes this month.",

    "text": "31819\n\nSi tua t i on\n\nOn 13 January, president Vizcarra announced that those who are irregular in the country will be immediately expelled. The aim is to protect the citizenry over the risen discontent with criminality growth. On 21 January, the Minister of Interior established a dedicated police task force to target criminal activity by foreigners in Peru. Organizations and activists criticized the measure and its negative impact on the growing discrimination and xenophobia against refugees and migrants from Venezuela. The government assured that the task force will adhere by human rights, but that crime has to be firmly prosecuted independent of the origin of those breaking the law. On 26 January a temporary Parliament has been elected to conclude the 2016-2021 legislative cycle. Its members will assume office in March 2020 until a new president and a new parliament take office. During the campaign, several new parliamentarians voiced their opposition to the flow of refugees and migrants from Venezuela, promising harsher entry and oversight policies.\n\nPartners have scaled up their shelter response through different initiatives such as covering electricity expenses, water and other basic services of nine shelters serving over 180 persons within the most vulnerable districts of Lima, and the distribution of hygiene kits in coordination with WASH efforts.\n\nIn Lima and Tacna shelters, partners have provided daily breakfast and dinner to more than 300 refugees and migrants, as well as three meals and snacks for children, pregnant women and persons with health problems. In Tumbes, this assistance is provided to more than 230 refugees and migrants and is complimented with protection support, information and orientation. Humanitarian transport (at interprovincial level) to more than 350 persons.\n\nChild protection partners ensured that psychosocial and socio emotional support was given to vulnerable children and their families. Initiatives for children aim to strengthen their resilience through the recognition of their own capacities and resources. Similarly, their families have access to safe spaces where they can share the emotional vicissitudes faced in displacement. Over 2,100 children also were supported through activities in the safe spaces.\n\nThese efforts seek to enable families to overcome the traumatic effects of displacement and uncertainty, and to build a new path forward.\n\n* From 01/01 to 29/02| **Source: FTS Website\n\nGTRM partners also ensure assistance to particularly vulnerable refugees and migrants through support spaces. This is an initiative that aims at strengthening community-\n\nbased protection and it is done mostly by local community\n\nand faith-based organizations.\n\nThrough the support spaces, partners have provided information, counselling and psychosocial support, access to food and core relief items, safe spaces for children, for women and for survivors of gender-based violence. Moreover, partners use these spaces to share information on nutrition, child protection in emergencies, hygiene, protection mechanisms and routes for survivors of GBV.\n\nTo register and regularize refugees and migrants, partners are supporting the Superintendence for Migrations (SNM) and the Special Commission for Refugees (CEPR) to issue documentation through two procedures, the carnet of calidad migratoria especial residente (CMER) and through asylum-seeker identity cards.\n\nPartners support the CEPR to decentralize their data base through the Qoricancha II system. The work is done at country level, in the 12 offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where asylum applications are received. This will enable interoperability between the registration systems of the CEPR and the SNM. So far some 21,000 applicants received their printed identity cards.\n\nPartners guaranteed the resources needed to secure the SNM staff and offices essential to assist Venezuelan\n\nnationals to shift from the PTP towards the Calidad Migratoria Especial Residente (CMER) preventing them from becoming irregular and so far supporting the issuance of CMER ID Cards to some 100,000 Venezuelans in order to obtain permanent residence status.",

In Brazil, entry restrictions were extended the until end of August and the restrictions on the entrance of Venezuelans remain, meaning that they will be at risk of deportation or repatriation and will not have access to documentation issued to regularly entered Venezuelans. In Colombia the national mandatory preventive isolation has been extended twice during the month. There is an increase of COVID-19 cases throughout Ecuador, where several cantons have returned to high alert status, and Quito is dealing with shortages of beds in the hospitals\u2019 intensive care units. In Peru, increased cases of human trafficking for sexual exploitation were identified in several cities in the country, increasing concerns over protection risks. In the Dominican Republic, heightened numbers of infections prompted a 45-day curfew and closure of land borders with Haiti. While Uruguay and Paraguay have managed to keep contagion at bay, Argentina and Bolivia continued to see an increase in COVID-19 cases, with public health facilities close to exceeding their capacities.\n\nThe situation of thousands of people living in remote areas along the Amazon river, between Colombia, Brazil and Peru, rises serious concerns about their access to prevention and health services, affecting especially Venezuelan indigenous peoples in those areas. Increasingly high COVID-19 mortality rates, chronic child malnutrition, high maternal mortality rates,\n\nmalaria, dengue and a lack of support pose severe risks to this population. With most borders being closed, facilities to lodge\n\nasylum applications or other migration procedures are elusive (some services are being processed through on-line platforms). Prolonged confinement measures in some countries are causing an increase in gender-based violence (GBV) and abuse.\n\nPlatforms\u2019 Response**\n\nIn Brazil, on 21 July, R4V partners collected information on needs in two communities in the municipality of Amajari, Roraima. The visits served to understand Venezuelans' situation, especially in the indigenous community 3 Cora\u00e7\u00f5es, where some 80 Venezuelans currently reside. During the month, R4V partners supported Brazilian authorities with the enrolment of refugees and migrants in the Sistema Acolhedor, with 214 new entries and 351 updates for different interiorization modalities. The activity aims at registering all refugees and migrants living in Boa Vista into the governmental database, while also identifying potential family groups that meet the criteria for other types of internal relocation within Brazil.\n\nR4V partners in Chile conducted needs assessments of refugees and migrants from Venezuela, including on emergency and mid- to long-term needs and perspectives, as well as on possible return intentions. Partners continued providing assistance such as NFIs, food and hygiene items to refugees and migrants from Venezuela in Santiago.\n\nIn Colombia, the Grupo Interagencial para Flujos Migratorios Mixtos\u2019 (GIFMM) priority was to guarantee preventative\n\nisolation of refugees and migrants through in-kind and multipurpose cash response for NFI, food, WASH and infrastructure. The GIFMM also continued supporting the government-run Center for Sanitary Care (Centro de Atenci\u00f3n\n\nSanitaria Transitoria \u2013 CAST, in Spanish), which is located at the Tienditas International Bridge in Norte de Santander, through the provision of temporary shelters, WASH, health and protection services to the refugee and migrant population awaiting to return to Venezuela. In addition, R4V partners monitored refugees and migrants at risk of eviction and prioritized\n\nassistance to those already evicted.\n\nThe Grupo de Trabajo para Refugiados y Migrantes (GTRM) in Ecuador throughout July increased its delivery of food assistance, NFIs, hygiene kits and COVID-19 protection kits, cash transfers for basic needs and protection interventions. A rise in informal border crossings to Colombia was reported, exposing Venezuelans to increasing protection risks. R4V partners supported Venezuelans with the humanitarian visa registration process which has been extended to mid-August.",

Soon after COVID-19 entered WACA, all 24 countries in the region closed schools, affecting an estimated 128 million children. Some countries are beginning to reopen schools, yet most are limited to school examination years, and many plans to achieve this before the end-of-year holidays have not been realised. Meanwhile, we know that girls are less likely to return to school after a period of absence due to domestic and care responsibilities falling on female family members, and preference for boys returning to school when families are struggling with school fees. Research in Niger has found that girls are more likely to be married if they are already not attending school.\n\nFurthermore, married girls face specific barriers to accessing\n\nexclude pregnant girls and/or young mothers from returning to school and completing their education. Following school closures during Ebola, pregnant adolescent girls faced specific stigma and discrimination in returning to school.\n\nDistance learning programmes are currently in place in multiple countries but not many children and fewer girls than boys have access to digital or radio devices to access online content, and girls have less time to engage in self-study due to household responsibilities that fall on them. Even where girls can access distance learning, Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) is commonly missing from distance education packages and during the current COVID-19 crisis girls are missing out on informal spaces to discuss menstruation and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR).\n\nSRHR-focused responses need to be at the centre of approaches to end child marriage. There is growing evidence showing that child marriage is both a cause and a consequence of adolescent pregnancy and is rooted in harmful gender norms and expectations around female sexuality and the perceived shame of a girl of becoming 1 2 pregnant outside of marriage. Female genital\n\nmutilation/cutting (FGM/C) also stems from a similar desire to control female sexuality, and is sometimes a precursor to child marriage. New cases of FGM/C during COVID-19 have already been documented in several African countries and UNFPA has predicted an additional 2 million cases of FGM/C due to COVID-19 than would otherwise have occurred over the next decade.\n\nDuring COVID-19, girls and young women face increased barriers to accessing SRH information and services. Married girls have very little negotiating power in relationships where there is a large age gap and often already struggle to access SRH services. These are critical services that need to be available to married girls, especially at this time of heightened intimate partner violence, and GBV more\n\nPregnant adolescent girls are particularly at risk if they cannot access critical maternal health information and services. Pregnancy is the leading cause of death for girls aged 15 to 19 and the risk to girls increases significantly in times of crisis. Younger girls are particularly at risk from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. They are also less likely to access essential SRH services due to their limited negotiating power and judgmental attitudes of service providers. In Sierra Leone, adolescent pregnancy increased by an estimated 65% in regions most affected by Ebola.\n\nAs a result of COVID-19, some governments in the region are diverting healthcare facilities to manage the pandemic. Services and healthcare access is further limited by the\n\nclosure of clinics, disruption in supply chains for contraceptives and restrictions on movement. Younger pregnant girls are at greatest risk because of their age and reduced negotiating power to access and use maternal and other SRH services. Fear of contracting COVID-19 is also dissuading many girls and women from attending ante-natal and post-natal appointments. During the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak, maternal mortality increased by an estimated 75% as resources were diverted to the outbreak response while the number of women giving birth in hospitals and health clinics dropped by approximately 30%.",

    "text": "47079\n\nNIGERIA Food Security Outlook Update December 2020 Persistent high levels of conflict drive high assistance needs during the post-harvest period\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n\nIncreased conflict observed in early December led to further displacement in the Northeast, particularly in Borno state, limiting access to farms, reducing the already expected below-normal harvest. This, coupled with atypically high market prices due to increased demand, below-average supply, and poor macroeconomic conditions, are driving low purchasing power among already vulnerable populations. As a result, more households are likely experiencing food consumption gaps indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes. A risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) persists, where Famine could occur in the event that households are cut off from typical food and income sources and food assistance for a prolonged period of time.\n\nArmed banditry, kidnapping, and cattle rustling activities have slightly increased in recent months in northwest and northcentral states. This is driving lower than regular engagement in income-earning and agricultural activities among most conflict-affected households. As a result, many poor households are mainly dependent on markets for food and are unable to meet non-food needs, experiencing Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes. Worst conflict-affected households in Zamfara, Sokoto, and Katsina states who remain displaced and have limited income or no humanitarian assistance are experiencing food consumption gaps and are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).\n\nHouseholds in areas less affected by conflict and/or flooding are consuming own foods normally and engaging in typical livelihood activities. Although some flood-affected households remain displaced and have constrained income, relying mainly on markets for food. Thus, they are in Stressed (IPC Phase 2). Many flood-affected households are expected to engage in dry season cultivation and will start consuming own foods with the harvest in April/May. As such, Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes are expected to\n\nProjected food security outcomes, December 2020 to January 2021\n\nSource: FEWS NET Projected food security outcomes, February to May 2021\n\nSource: FEWS NET\n\nFEWS NET classification is IPC-compatible. IPC-compatible analysis follows key IPC protocols but does not necessarily reflect the consensus of national food security partners.\n\nMacroeconomic conditions remain fragile, with the continued increase in the annual inflation, although slightly, despite the rise in international crude oil prices as foreign reserves continue to decline. Though the value of the NGN remains relatively stable, the value of the currency remains lower than last year and the average. Despite the harvest, prices are not seasonally decreasing due to the macroeconomic pressure on the markets and atypically high market demand as many households lost some, if not all, their harvest due to flooding or conflict. Food prices across the country are above- average, with prices even higher in conflict-affected areas of the Northeast.\n\nFEWS NET Nigeria\n\nFEWS NET is a USAID-funded activity.

As of 19 April 2021\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nThe security situation in Ag Geneina town is calm, with no fighting reported over the past 10 days\n\nProtection of civilians is a top priority; people report that security is the main reason they cannot return home\n\nHumanitarian organisations are scaling up operations, replenishing stock, and deploying more staff, food distribution started on 18 April\n\nOffloading of food supplies in Ag Geneina, West Darfur 17 Apr 2021 - WFP\n\nThe security situation in Ag Geneina is calm, with no reports of gunfire or any acts of violence over the weekend, according to reports received. Life is returning to normal, and people are moving freely around the town. There are reports of some people returning to four neighbourhoods around Hay Al Jabal area, however, the number of people is yet to be confirmed. Most markets are open; however, prices are higher than before the recent bout of violence. The city electricity and water supply network are gradually being restored.\n\nIn a meeting on 15 April, the State Minister of Interior reiterated that the Government is committed to ensure security and provide protection to those affected as well as humanitarian partners. He called on humanitarian partners to immediately respond to the emergency.\n\nThe recent inter-communal fighting has displaced 40,000 people, bringing the total number of people displaced in West Darfur this year to over 149,000. The Humanitarian Aid Commission confirmed that there are 13 new gathering points where internally displaced people sought shelter, bringing the total to 97. In these recent clashes 117 people have been killed and 283 injured.\n\nSome humanitarian organisations have deployed more staff to support the emergency in Ag Geneina. They are assessing the needs of the newly displaced and have started supplying live-saving aid. On 17 April, trucks loaded with food assistance arrived in Ag Geneina, carrying more than 200 metric tons of emergency food rations, including cereals, pulses, oil and salt.\n\nAlso on 17 April, food security sector partners carried out initial verifications to assess how many people are in need of urgent food assistance, to move quickly in providing them the needed support. The distribution of one-month food rations for affected people in Ag Geneina started on 18 April.\n\nMeanwhile, an inter-agency needs assessment to determine the number of people in need and scale-up support is expected to proceed on 19 April. Some humanitarian organisations have resumed their water, sanitation and hygiene services in at least 15 gathering points in Ag Geneina.\n\nPage 1 of 2\n\nDownloaded: 19 Apr 2021\n\nPage 2 of 2\n\nDownloaded: 19 Apr 2021",

An e-flyer on the same was also produced. Please find the paper here and the e-flyer here. The Protection Cluster and OHCHR continue to monitor protection risks emerging during this period. Incidents of cattle raiding and inter-communal violence have increased in the first quarter of this year compared to last year with a total of 204 incidences reported since January 2020 to March 2020. Affected communities face multiple protection issues including GBV. Many communities are still recovering from the aftermaths of recent floods, previous inter-communal violence and cattle raids incidences, limited resources and access to services, protracted cases of displacements and associated protection concerns. The restrictions of movement due to COVID-19 has hampered the humanitarian response including for mobile protection teams. Partners with static presence in affected areas are being replied upon to assess and respond to the situation. The Protection Cluster Roving team is closely monitoring the general protection situation of IDPs in settlements in Juba. Prioritization of Activities for protection cluster partner on critical activities and related modalities that should be undertaken to ensure continuity during COVID\u2013 19 was shared with all partners. The guide recommends necessary adjustments to protection activities as a result of COVID-19. Please find here the prioritization of activities. The Protection Cluster continues to participate in varied task forces of the COVID-19 response, including the National Steering Committee on COVID-19 and the Risk Communication and Community Engagement technical working group, ensuring the centrality of protection in the COVID-19 response.\n\nMarch 2020 Protection cluster email: protectionclustersouthsudan@gmail.com\n\nSource of data: Protection Cluster 5W dataset, cluster partners and UNOCHA FTS portal\n\nGender Based Violence Sub Cluster\n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day celebrations\n\nThere were countrywide celebrations of the International Women\u2019s Day at the National Level and state levels.

Training aimed at raising awareness among the newly unified forces on their role in preventing the recruitment and use of child soldiers. Forces were trained on what constitutes a child soldier (including girl child soldiers), why child soldiers are a concern for the security sector, and operational and tactical planning to prevent recruitment of children. Training was conducted at the organized forces training site in Masna Bira (Wau), the NCO Academy in Mapel (Wau), and the Dakum Training Centre (Wau).

    "text": "52929\n\nCOVID-19 EXTERNAL UPDATE\n\nAsia and the Pacific 9 February 2021\n\nPersons of concern Refugees and Asylum Highlights by country\n\nInternally displaced\n\nStateless persons\n\nSouth-West Asia\n\n\u2022 UNHCR has modified ongoing activities to ensure protection services can continue during the pandemic. Interventions for persons with specific needs and cash assistance programs for refugees have been modified to enable case assessment by phone. In addition, Community Based Protection Monitoring is now primarily conducted through household-level interviews rather than focus group discussions. UNHCR has also developed a COVID-19 questionnaire together with the Protection Cluster to assess the impact of, and needs due to, the pandemic. \u2022 The Government of Afghanistan and the UN are preparing for the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine across the country, including the development of a National Vaccine Deployment Plan. According to OCHA, while GAVI had provided funding through the COVAX facility to cover vaccine costs for up to 20 per cent of the population, the World Bank and Asia Development Bank have recently committed to provide funds to cover an additional 40 per cent of the population. The World Bank\u202falso approved\u202ftwo grants totalling to\u202fUSD 85 million\u202ffor Afghanistan.\u202fThe two grants aims\u202fto (1) improve access to and quality of water supply in Kabul, Kandahar, and Herat and strengthen the capacity of Afghanistan Urban Water Supply and\u202fSewerage\u202fCorporation to deliver sustainable services and contribute to national efforts to manage COVID-19 and other disasters; and (2) improve the delivery of core infrastructure, emergency support, and social\u202fservices\u202fto communities through strengthened Community Development Councils.\n\nIslamic Republic of Iran \u2022 Refugee children continue to study from home. In view of connectivity issues and lack of sufficient ICT equipment, UNHCR procured some 21,500 tablets for distribution to vulnerable refugee and host\n\ncommunity schoolchildren in refugee hosting areas. Refugees living in urban settings can access testing and treatment at MoH designated 16-hour centers \u2013 those enrolled in universal public health insurance only have to pay 10% of the treatment cost at MoH-affiliated hospitals, while others will pay a fee similar to Iranian nationals. While refugees have access to treatment in private hospitals in principle, this is not covered by UPHI and hence is prohibitively expensive. The cost of housing has been one of the major challenges faced by refugees. Given the loss of income and the absence of job opportunities due to the pandemic, refugees report being obliged to move to remote areas with cheaper prices.\n\n\u2022 Cash distribution to the most vulnerable refugee families concluded on 31 December 2020. In total, 75,104 refugee families have received assistance, which mirrors the Government\u2019s Ehsaas emergency cash program. Vulnerable refugee families received Rs.12,000 (approximately $77) to cover a four-month period. Cash assistance was disbursed in 55 districts and 54 refugee villages across Pakistan through an innovative partnership with the Pakistan Post. \u2022 COVID-related health problems the government-run health facilities and major hospitals remain open and accessible to persons of concern in Pakistan. A second wave of COVID-19 started in late October and peaked between November and mid-December. During this period, Pakistan reported around 3,500 new cases a day with steep increase in hospitalization and mortality and hospital capacity under strain. However, in last two weeks of January, case numbers started to decline to their current level of less than 2,000 per day. Health facilities in all the refugee villages are functional.\n\nRegistration, documentation issuance and distribution are currently suspended in the country office Islamabad as a precautionary measure to prevent COVID-19. The country office is only processing urgent or emergency cases.\n\nSouth-East Asia\n\n\u2022 The humanitarian community, authorities and refugee volunteers continue information dissemination in the camps regarding health and safety precautions during the pandemic. Notably, refugees have begun seeking information about possibilities and modalities for future vaccinations. \u2022 In the Rohingya refugee camps, UNHCR has begun to implement the \u2018Girl Shine\u2019 model, a program conceived in response to assessments indicating that adolescent Rohingya girls are at heightened risk of GBV during the pandemic.

    "text": "5466\n\nGeneral Context\n\nIn Al Hudaydah hub, the Government of Yemen backed by the SLC (Saudi Led Coali- tion) Forces launched an attack to capture Red sea port city of Hudaydah on 13th June. This resulted in significant displacement in adjacent coastal districts of Ad Du- rayhimi, Al Marawi'ah, Zabid among others with the displacement of over 20,000 IDP families in Al Hudaydah Governorate over the month.\n\nIn Ibb hub, In Taizz, continued fighting in Al Hudaydah forced 1,492 families to flee their homes and settle in the southern districts. It was reported that military groups have mounted checkpoints leading to southern Taizz and are not allowing IDPs partic- ularly from Al Hudaydah to pass through. Many families reported that they cannot afford the cost of transport out of Al Hudaydah as well as being concerned that their homes and shops may be looted or occupied.\n\nIn Sana\u2019a hub, clashes in Al Hudaydah coastal areas and Al Bayda also resulted in\n\nthe displacement to Amran, Dhamar, Sana\u2019a and Amanat Al Asimah. Further the hu-\n\nmanitarian situation of the affected population in Marib governorate and the resi- dents of Alkhaniq IDP hosting site in Sana\u2019a governorate significantly deteriorated due to the continuation of armed clashes in nearby areas, access issues, increased waves of displacements and low presence of humanitarian actors.\n\nIn Sa\u2019adah hub, new waves of displacement continued to be generated from the front line districts in Sa\u2019adah and Al Jawf, resulting in further increased vulnerability of the affected population as the coping mechanisms of the families are continually\n\nIn Aden and Al Mukala hubs, The ongoing fighting in Al Hudaydah and Taizz front- lines led to large displacements mainly from areas such Hays, Al Khawkhah, At Tuha- yat, Ad Durayhimi, Zabid and Bayt Al Faqiah districts in Al Hudaydah governorate and Mawza and Al Wazi'iyah districts in south Taizz to the southern governorates. This is in addition to new influx of displacement from Al Bayda governorate frontlines into areas in Nati' district located between Al Bayda and Bayhan district in Shabwah Gov-\n\nRecent Situational Developments\n\nThe National Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster organized two meetings: a general monthly meeting held on 10th of June to present the Cluster strategy for the HPF 2018 (Humanitarian Pooled Fund) First and Reserve allocations and the Shelter Solutions methodology; an ad-hoc meeting held on 4th of June to discuss collaborative partner- ships for the Pooled Fund Allocations as part of the Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster strate- gy to improve capacity of Cluster Partners while also improving the reach of the Clus- ter. An agreement was concluded between the Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster, IOM (International Organization for Migration) and the UK\u2019s DFID (Department For Inter- national Development) for the provision and transport of in-kind assistance of 2,500 NFI kits and 3,000 Family tents to be airlifted through Aden and transported by IOM to priority Governorates for distribution to newly displaced families.\n\nSNCC (Sub-National Cluster Coordinator) in Al Hudaydah hub; the Sub-National Clus- ter organized their monthly meeting on the 10th of June to discuss the new displace- ments figures and immediate response to the needs of affected population. To pro- vide an emergency response to the newly displaced families, Transit Sites were estab- lished to enable the provision of RRM (Rapid Response Mechanism) kits including Dignity kits, Sanitary kits and dry food rations. Afterwards families were targeted with cash assistance NFI and shelter support.\n\nTwitter: @YEShelterCCCM\n\nSITUATION REPORT\n\nJune 2018\n\nSNCC in Ibb hub; YWU (Yemen Women Union) completed the verification of 601 families in Ibb and 772 families in north Taizz. These families were displaced from the conflict affected areas in Al Hudaydah.\n\nSNCC in south Taizz; the Sub-National Cluster held their monthly meeting on the 27th of June to discuss the new displacements and gaps in the response as well as the priorities of the Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster for the first HPF 2018 standard allocation. It was agreed that the humanitarian partners including NRC, CARE International, SCI (Save the Children) and others, will conduct assessments and verification for the newly displaced families in Al Ma'afer, Ash Shamayatayn, Al Mawasit, Al Misrakh, Al Mudhaffar, Salh and Al Qa- hirah districts with 1,492 families verified during the period. The Local authorities reported that there were 2,738 IDP families who fled Al Hudaydah and settled in these districts in south Taizz and verification will continue.",

    "text": "497\n\nYemen Humanitarian Bulletin | 2\n\nThe number of people in need does not include additional needs that were created by the three-week blockade imposed by the Saudi-led Coalition on commercial imports bound to the Red Sea ports of Saleef and Al Hudaydah in November 2017, and the week of intense fighting in the capital, Sana\u2019a, in early December.\n\n10 per cent of all Yemenis have been displaced in the last 30 months\n\nArmed clashes, airstrikes and localised attacks on civilians have taken a devastating toll on the people of Yemen and generated widespread protection needs. About 12.9 million people need assistance to protect their safety, dignity or basic rights, from violations of International Humanitarian Law, grave violations of children\u2019s rights and gender-based violence. From October 2016 to September 2017, almost 8,900 conflict-related incidents, including airstrikes, armed clashes and shelling, were reported throughout Yemen \u2013 of which 82 per cent occurred in five governorates: Taizz, Sa\u2019ada, Al Jawf, Hajjah, and Sana\u2019a. More than 10 per cent of all Yemenis have experienced the shock of displacement due to conflict in the last 30 months.\n\nMost of those who have been displaced are struggling to cope because prolonged violence has brought the economy to its knees, exacerbated pre-existing vulnerabilities, degraded community resilience and accelerated the collapse of public institutions. Imports and internal movement of goods have become more difficult due to security- related restrictions, with enterprises reducing operating time by a half and laying off more than half of the workforce.\n\nAccess to services severely disrupted by continuing conflict\n\nOnly 50 per cent of health facilities in 16 governorates are functional, but lack supplies or are manned by health workers who have not received salaries for months. An estimated 16.4 million people require assistance to obtain healthcare \u2013 of whom 9.3 million are in acute need.\n\nStatus of health facilities\n\nSource: WHO, MoH; Service availability and health facilities functionality in 16 governorates (Oct. 2016)\n\nEducation has been disrupted and two million children are out of school. The discontinuation of the payment of teacher salaries has created an education crisis, risking a generation of illiterate children if no mitigation measures are put in place. UNICEF reports that between March 2015 and November 2017, out of 16,000 schools, around 256 schools were reportedly destroyed, 1,413 schools were partially damaged due to airstrikes or shelling while 150 schools were occupied by IDPs and 23 by armed groups. Teachers across the country have not been regularly paid salaries for more than a year.\n\nIn most areas of Yemen, WASH systems have been severely disrupted due to shortages hygiene facilities. Inadequate access to water and proper sanitation contributed to a spike\n\nYemen Humanitarian Bulletin | 3\n\non the achievements made in 2017 in refining the methodology for multi-cluster analysis and response, the response will strategically target populations in acute need or at risk of slipping into acute need at the district level.\n\nVulnerable areas where the risk of famine, disease outbreak and protracted displacement for IDPs, returnees and host communities converge will be prioritised through an integrated response to address humanitarian needs in a more effective and sustainable manner. Additionally, the 2018 Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan\u2019s (YHRP) strategy is to work with national institutions to prevent their collapse, support resilience and livelihoods, and ensure the humanitarian-development continuum. The priority is to strengthen partnerships between national and international partners and systematically engage in capacity-building. Currently, 153 humanitarian partners are working in Yemen including 109 national NGOs, 36 international NGOs and eight UN agencies.\n\nThe importance of keeping all Yemen\u2019s ports open and functional\n\nIt is critical that the parties to the conflict keep all points of entry open",

The targeted Priority One Counties are: Pibor, Akobo, Tonj North, Tonj South, Tonj East and Aweil South. The targeted Priority Two Counties are: Ayod, Duk, Twic East and Bor. \uf0b7 In January, WFP assisted a total of 263,556 (97 percent of the targeted people) people living in Priority One Counties, with over 7,800 mt of food and nutrition items. \uf0b7 For the month of February 2021, WFP plans to reach 283,168 beneficiaries in Priority One Counties. Additionally, WFP plans to\n\nreach 258,627 beneficiaries in Priority Two Counties.\n\nFood and Nutrition Assistance \uf0b7 In the Greater Pibor Administrative Area, WFP distributed a total of 2,575 mt of food and nutrition items to 93,450 beneficiaries (100 percent of targeted people). 2018-2020 Interim Country Strategic Plan (ICSP) was extended into 2021, \uf0b7 In Warrap State, WFP distributed 263 mt of food and nutrition items and may be considered for a further extension, to align with the United to 8,052 people in Tong East, 626 mt to 24,333 people in Tonj North, Nations Cooperation Framework in South Sudan. and 1,358 mt to 50,000 people in Tonj South.\n\nContact info: wfp.southsudan@wfp.org Country Director: Matthew Hollingworth Further information: https://www1.wfp.org/countries/south-sudan Photo Credit: WFP/ Gabriela Vivacqua\n\nUrban Safety Net \uf0b7 WFP revised its objective for the Urban Safety Net project, and will be only able to provide assistance to 98,000 beneficiaries (from the original plan of 131,000 beneficiaries) in the cities of Juba, Wau, Aweil and Rumbek. This diminution of people served is due to an anticipated increase in the cash-based transfer (CBT) value over the course of the year, calculated following an analysis of price evolution forecasts, as well as financial constraints that imped WFP to provide adequate CBT entitlements to the initial number of beneficiaries. WFP provides direct cash for emergency food needs and support skills development through vocational training opportunities, such as home gardening, small business management, saving and lending schemes, hygiene promotion, basic financial numeracy and craft and sawing. Additionally, a further 5,500 beneficiaries will receive support in Juba and Aweil, focusing on vocational training and income generating activities.\n\n\uf0b7 Provide nutrition-sensitive food assistance to crisis- affected populations. \uf0b7 Provide food and nutrition assistance to refugees\n\n\uf0b7 Provide nutrition assistance to populations at risk of\n\n\uf0b7 Provide livelihood support and build the resilience of rural \uf0b7 Provision of infrastructure development services for\n\nhumanitarian access and community\n\n\uf0b7 Operate Air Services for the Humanitarian Community \uf0b7 Coordinate the Logistics Cluster in Support of the Humanitarian Community \uf0b7 Supply Chain provision \uf0b7 Inter-Agency IT Communication Service \uf0b7 SCOPE Service to humanitarian partners \uf0b7 Provision of IT services to the humanitarian community \uf0b7 Provision of infrastructure development services",

The Logistics Cluster team will be facilitating the movement and compiling the requests. Please submit your completed SRF to mozambique.cargorequests@wfp.org as soon as possible to load all cargo on Wednesday 27 March\n\nThe handling capacity at Beira airport is stretched. WFP, as global lead of the Logistics Cluster, has reached an agreement with a logistics company in Mozambique to assist with handling, loading and offloading activities at Beira airport. Partners are encouraged to share the pipeline of incoming cargo with the Logistics Cluster to avoid creating bottlenecks.\n\nDFID is sending handling equipment, including a K-loader and heavy lifting forklifts, to Beira airport (expected 27 March) and 3-4 staff, including trainers, to build the capacity of the handling service providers at the airport.\n\nMAF International has one aircraft in-country (Cessna 208; 0.82 mt capacity) which can be made available to the humanitarian community.

    "text": "15967\n\nTestimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa and International Terrorism\n\n\u201cThe Conflict in Libya\u201d\n\nMegan Doherty, Senior Director for Policy and Advocacy, Mercy Corps May 15, 2019\n\nChairman Deutch, Ranking Member Wilson, and Members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the conflict in Libya and implications for U.S. policy. I am grateful to the Subcommittee for giving this important issue the attention it deserves. After a brief analysis of the current humanitarian situation, my testimony will focus on recommendations for the international community and U.S. policymakers.\n\nThe deepening humanitarian crisis in Libya is entirely man-made. The civilian casualties and violations of international humanitarian law are eminently avoidable and require a political solution. Despite the alarming situation on the ground, there is a fragile, waning window of opportunity for the United States to prevent further deterioration, allow humanitarian aid to reach people in need, and push the warring parties to negotiate.\n\nSince the overthrow of venal dictator Moammar Qadhafi in 2011, Libya has struggled with weak institutions, prolonged insecurity exploited by criminal and terrorist actors, and malign international meddling. As rival factions have clashed in violent bids for territory, resources, and deliver safety and improvements to their quality of life.\n\nBefore the recent outbreak of violence, Libya had made some modest recent recovery gains, including restarting oil production and preventing ISIS from establishing a new caliphate in Sirte in 2016. The escalating violence threatens to unravel these gains and destabilize Libya and the region. We have seen before that chaos in Libya does not stay within its borders: the choices we make in this crisis will reverberate throughout the region.\n\nKhalifa Haftar and his self-proclaimed Libyan National Army (LNA), a loose confederation of tribal and city militias, ignited the current conflict when they attacked Tripoli and the civilian-led Government of National Accord (GNA) on April 4. The attack came days before a planned United Nations-led national dialogue conference to negotiate interim power-sharing agreements and a roadmap for elections.\n\nIn the past six weeks alone, fighting in Tripoli has killed more than 450, injured more than 2,000, and displaced more than 62,000 people.1\n\nHere are the key consequences:\n\nCivilians are at risk. Violent conflict, including airstrikes and rocket attacks in civilian million people in urban Tripoli anxiously watching the frontlines inch closer to their homes.\n\nMass displacement. More than 62,000 people have fled their homes since the crisis began. The families with less money to afford food.\n\nAccess to food and services is shrinking. Six weeks of urban warfare have damaged power hospitals or housing centers for displaced families.\n\nThe health sector is collapsing. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that Tripoli\u2019s weeks WHO Emergency Medical Teams (EMT) performed almost 250 surgeries. Hospitals are running out of blood, beds, medicine, and emergency supplies.\n\nHospitals and health workers are being attacked in clear violation of international was hit in an apparent direct attack.5\n\nRefugees and migrants are extremely vulnerable. More than 3,100 refugees and migrants in detention centers in Tripoli and surrounding areas are at great risk of abuse, injury, and death.6\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA), Libya: Tripoli Clashes - Situation Report #23, May 10, 2019. These figures include only cases that could be individually verified, and so must be considered a minimum. UNOCHA, Libya: Tripoli Clashes - Situation Report #21, May 5, 2019.

    "text": "13772\n\nContext and Methodology\n\nStarting on 04 April 2019, as a result of rapid military advances from the South of Libya, Tripoli\u2019s southern suburbs experienced high levels of conflict. The deteriorating security situation has displaced over 78,225 people as of 19 May (IOM DTM) and damaged public infrastructures, including water supply and electricity lines. 126 civilian casualties, including 29 civilian deaths have been confirmed. 3,371 migrants remain in detention centres in Tripoli and nearby areas (OCHA).\n\nThis mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (mVAM) bulletin is based on data collected from Libyans via live telephone interviews conducted between 16 April and 06 May 2019. The telephone numbers called were collected in August 2018 during a representative face-to-face assessment. Findings are complemented by key informants from WFP and partner organisation staff on the ground.\n\nThe data presented was collected from a sample of 66 respondents from 7 municipalities in and around Tripoli (Janzour, Abusliem, Ain Zara, Hai Alandalus, Suq Aljumaa, Tajoura and Tripoli centre). Responses are aggregated and reported at the municipality level.\n\nSource: WFP Libya 2018\n\nQuestionnaire and data are available here.\n\n27% of respondents expressed an intention to move from their home if conflict continues. This percentage is higher in Suq Aljumaa (45%) and Tripoli centre (44%). However, respondents indicated that they don\u2019t necessarily have a safe place to move to. As reported by IOM, most of the displaced people come from areas close to the clashes in Southern Tripoli (Ain Zara, Qasr Ben Gashir). In eastern Tripoli, Tajoura respondents also indicate that many households have left their homes. The majority of IDP families are currently staying in private accommodation (IOM DTM). mVAM respondents indicate that they are mostly hosted by family or friends, but community shelters and rented accommodations were also mentioned. 2,700 IDPs are hosted in 29 collective shelters (OCHA).\n\nSource: IOM DTM\n\n\uf0b7 Half of the respondents know about food assistance delivered to vulnerable people in their municipality. ICRC, WFP and STACO* are the organisations currently delivering food that most respondents are familiar with.\n\nIn the Tajoura municipality, only 20% of the respondents are aware of food distributions to vulnerable people.\n\n91% of respondents have no issue in accessing local markets but in Ain Zara, 25% of the respondents indicate it\u2019s too dangerous to go\n\nto the market \u2013 the situation varies within Ain Zara as the municipality is large and some parts are directly affected by the clashes. In particular, in Khallat al Furjan neighbourhood (Ain Zara) and Swani Bin Adam municipality, all markets were reported to be closed during the first weeks of May (IOM DTM).\n\nFood products are mostly available in the local markets of Tripoli.\n\nIn Ain Zara, some respondents (14%) report troubles in finding cooking fuel, milk or tomatoes which confirm disparities in availability of food products between areas in close proximity to the clashes and the rest of Tripoli (REACH and IOM).\n\nBread price is stable: 4 regular-size loaves of bread cost 1 LYD in all monitored municipalities.\n\nMain staple (couscous, pasta, rice) prices are stable. These\n\ncommodities are mostly imported and road access to Tripoli as well as sea access through the ports are open at the time of reporting. Impact of conflict on imported goods supply chains could take longer thanks to available stocks.\n\nFresh vegetable prices have increased by more than 20% since the beginning of the crisis. Fresh vegetables are locally\n\nproduced in farms south of Tripoli (Qasr Bin Ghasheer and Wadi Rabie) and the main wholesale vegetable market is also in Southern Tripoli (Qasr Bin Ghasheer). Supply chain are disrupted by the conflict and an increase in demand due to the month of Ramadan are driving the price increases. Respondents in Tripoli centre also indicate that the price of milk and vegetable oil has increased.",

Within the Inter-Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) in Cox's Bazar, FSS is a plat- form to strengthen the food security response through operational coordination, information sharing, and identifying food security related priorities and solutions. In light of COVID-19 pandemic, FSS partners adapted their delivery of assistance to mitigate infection risks in the camps through pre-packaging food rations, protecting older persons through home delivery of food rations, integrating high energy biscuits and Super Cereal to monthly rations as well as increasing monthly entitlements to provide extra nutrition, and limiting the number of visits and distribution rounds. Unconditional food and cash assistance was provided to vulnerable Bangladeshi households in all Upazilas of Cox\u2019s Bazar District to improve food security and compensate for economic repercussions of COVID-19.\n\nLivelihoods Working Group (LHWG): Under the FSS, the LHWG is working to strengthen coordination and technical support of the liveli- hood activities in the host community and Rohingya refugee camps. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, LHWG partners transitioned health and safety concerns, decreased supply chain access, and the objective to offer livelihoods opportunities into a local mask making initiative. LHWG is supporting in operational coordination of production and distribution of masks in the camps and host community.\n\nThis information booklet covers activities of and information shared by partners from April to August. Included in this booklet are: 1) Rohingya humanitarian crisis dashboard which provides a summary of the response; 2) operational partner presence to inform who is doing what where; 3) gap analysis showing coverage gaps by each assistance type; 4) assessments by partners; and 5) key documents.

Over 2,500 Carn\u00e9 de Extranjer\u00eda and 86 Temporary Stay Permit (PTP) certificates were downloaded. Further information is available here. Peru scaled up to number seven in the global COVID-19 ranking with some 244,000 cases confirmed. Currently, there are over 160 refugees and migrants with COVID-19. According to the Ombudsperson's Office an average of five denounces are filed daily on the disappearance of women, teenagers and girls amid the state of emergency.\n\nDropping temperatures increase the need to provide shelter and winter support to vulnerable refugees and migrants from Venezuela. The cold weather intensifies concerns over food security, health and risk of eviction.\n\nProtection, CBI and Integration\n\nGTRM partners trained health workers to prevent and mitigate protection risks for children. Training calendar available here. \u2022 Partners are including vulnerable host community members confirmed with COVID-19 within their CBI interventions for food security in Ancash. Moreover, partners have reached an arrangement with a financial institution to accept other identification documents, including the cedula for Andean countries and refugee IDs, overcoming some of the challenges faced by refugees and migrants to receive CBI. \u2022 Integration partners are working on the establishment of a platform to avoid the duplication of persons assisted through capacity developments programs for entrepreneurship and seed capital.\n\nOPERATIONAL MEASURES\n\nTo date, USD 2,400,000 have been distributed on Cash-Based Interventions (CBI) in support of 52,000 refugees and migrants in Peru. Distributions focused in Lima, Arequipa, Callao, Cusco, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Madre de Dios, Piura, Tacna and Tumbes.\n\nGTRM partners provided medicines to some 100 vulnerable refugees and migrants through health brigades in shelters in Lima and Tumbes. Some 700 refugees and migrants receive shelter and food assistance in more than 20 shelters and collective accommodations in Arequipa, Lima, Puno, Tacna and Tumbes.\n\nREFUGEES AND MIGRANTS ASSISTED.",

The month of October saw the most violent and bloody attacks on education experienced since the beginning of the crisis in 2017. Incidents reported this month include cases of\n\nkilling, torture and abduction of students and teachers, as well as arson of education facilities. Major incidents were recorded in Bui and Mezam divisions in the North-West region (NW), Meme, Fako and Boyo divisions in the South-West (SW), with the Kumba massacre on 24 October being the deadliest and most violent attack. At least eight children were killed, and more than a dozen were wounded after unidentified gunmen stormed the Mother Francisca International Bilingual Academy in Kumba, Meme division on that day. On 23 October, the day before, 15 students of the Progressive Comprehensive College of Bamenda were reportedly abducted by non-state armed group (NSAG) fighters while returning from school. They were taken to an unknown destination and tortured. Six of them were released on the same day and the others on a later date. Both NSAGs and Government security forces accused each other of the massacre in Kumba as well as of other\n\nattacks against education. Between 27 and 30 October women and children marched on the streets of many towns in the NWSW demanding an end to the crisis. The Humanitarian Coordinator in Cameroon released a statement on 24 October condemning the killing of students in Kumba.\n\nSeparatist have remained divided on their position with regards to education. While some separatists called openly on social media for a resumption of schooling, pupils, students and teachers continue to be physically attacked and to receive threats from other separatists through audio messages. No NSAG group has issued any public statement to reflect that orders\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 3 START] *********\n\nCAMEROON: North-West and South-West, Situation Report No. 24 | 3\n\nhave been given to the fighters under their influence to avoid any threats or other targeting of schools as well as children, teachers and parents.\n\nIncidents perpetrated by Government security forces were also reported in October. This includes security forces forcibly transporting children to Government schools in military vans, the occupation of non-operational school facilities, and the closing down of informal or community schools in favour of Government schools. Such incidents were reported in Ngo-\n\nKetunjia, Bui and Donga Mantung divisions, all in the NW region.",

The ICSP helps WFP and its partners to work with the Libyan people to achieve zero hunger by 2030, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

    "text": "37692\n\nCOVID-19 EMERGENCY RESPONSE UPDATE\n\nUNHCR Regional Bureau for Middle East and North Africa COVID-19 Emergency Response Update #12\n\n19 August 2020\n\nAlgeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Western Sahara, Yemen, and Turkey\n\nout of 20 UNHCR countries / operations are reporting COVID-19 cases i n the region\n\nRegional Developments\n\n16 million 2020 planning figure for people of concern in the Middle East and North Africa\n\ncases of active COVID-19 reported among POCs\n\nincluding fatalities\n\nFollowing the deadly blast in Beirut, Lebanon on 4 August, nearly 220 people have died, 6,000 people injured and a reported 300,000 displaced. The impact of the Beirut Port explosion has been felt across much of Beirut, if not Lebanon, creating immediate humanitarian needs on top of what were already trying times.\n\nThe exposure has affected everyone, regardless of nationality or status. UNHCR is contacting all refugee households residing in affected areas and ensuring referrals for onward support. As of 14 August, UNHCR is aware that the total number of confirmed refugee deaths stands at 13 individuals, with 224 injured. The explosions hit as Lebanon faces a multi-faceted crisis. In recent months, the socio-economic situation of Lebanese, refugees and migrant workers has continued to deteriorate, with the cost of basic needs exponentially rising as a result of the deep economic and financial crisis, exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19. The number of positive COVID-19 cases in Lebanon has significantly increased over the past two weeks, with a further spike expected in the coming period.\n\nUNHCR calls on the international community to stand by the people of Lebanon, show solidarity and provide meaningful support to this generous country that has hosted so many refugees even during a very difficult period.\n\nUNHCR is mobilizing, together with other humanitarian partners to respond to the immediate needs to the most affected and most vulnerable households and individuals in Lebanon, including Lebanese, refugees and migrant workers. Efforts are focussed on shelter assistance and protection interventions which have been included in the recently launched Inter- Agency Humanitarian Appeal for Lebanon, with financial requirements of USD 565 million, of which USD 35 million are UNHCR\u2019s requirements. Health support is already covered under UNHCR\u2019s COVID-19 Appeal, launched earlier this year.\n\nUNHCR Turkey reports to the UNHCR Europe Bureau, although operations in Turkey related to the Syria & Iraq Situations are included in the MENA update The breakdown of confirmed COVID-19 cases is as follows: Egypt (25, with another 113 suspected and probable cases), Iraq (90), Lebanon (125), Mauritania (6) and Yemen (8). The change in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases among UNHCR POCs in MENA is a result of increased monitoring across Operations, and not indicative of a rise in COVID-19 transmissions.\n\nCOVID-19 EMERGENCY RESPONSE UPDATE / 19 AUGUST 2020\n\nMain Lines of Response\n\nadapting and protection and assistance to the most vulnerable\n\nwith communities\n\nto prevent infections and supporting access to services and materials\n\nAdvocating for the inclusion of refugees, IDPs\n\nand other marginalized\n\ngroups into national public health and other responses, and supporting national systems to deliver assistance\n\nindividuals and families to make the best decisions for themselves, through cash-based assistance\n\nUNHCR Lebanon Health Response\n\nHighlights from the field\n\nIn Iraq, there have been a total of 90 COVID-19 cases (79 of whom are active) among UNHCR\u2019s persons of concern in Iraq; up from 18 cases in the previous weeks. Most of the new cases have been recorded in Baghdad and Erbil. UNHCR is coordinating closely with the Departments of Health of the affected areas and is monitoring the situation closely. Contact tracing and testing have been conducted, and the Camp Coordination and Camp Management COVID-19 preparedness and response plans have been activated and implemented in all affected camps, including strict movement restrictions.",

    "text": "19568\n\nThe security situation in northeast Nigeria remains volatile, with changes in\n\nmilitary deployments and related hostilities leading to further displacement and a reduction in humanitarian access and services, especially in Gubio, Magumeri and Nganzai LGAs. The coming weeks and months are likely to see further population movements - especially in Maiduguri where existing camps are already overcrowded and there is an urgent need for additional land to shelter displaced families.\n\nSeasonal rains and windstorms have caused significant damage, with an estimated 21,056 households affected in the three states - especially Borno (MMC/Jere, Monguno, Gwoza and Dikwa LGAs) and Adamawa (Yola South and Yola North LGAs). Among the damage are approximately 500 latrines and bathing facilities. The destruction of WASH infrastructure and standing water, along with a pre-existing high degree of overcrowding and poor hygiene practices, are leading to an increased risk of contracting diseases. Humanitarian actors continue to respond to cholera in Adamawa, where a cumulative total of 665 cases and 4 deaths have been reported in 3 LGAs.\n\nUNICEF\u2019s response with partners\n\n*Total Results are cumulative, since January 2019\n\nSituation Report\n\n1-31 August 2019 4.2 million Children in need of humanitarian assistance\n\n(Humanitarian Response Plan, 2019)\n\n7.1 million People in need of humanitarian assistance in the northeast states of Borno, Adamawa & Yobe (HRP,\n\n6.1 million People targeted in the northeast states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (HRP, 2019)\n\n1.79 million Internally displaced people in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states (IOM DTM Round XXVII, May 2019)\n\nUNICEF Appeal 2019 US$ 120.1 million\n\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Needs\n\nThe reporting period continued to witness significant population movement, with 14,981 departures and 4,619 arrivals. Areas that accounted for the most departures include Gubio, Magumeri, Geidam and Busari, in part because of changes in military deployments that have led to increased hostilities and fear of attack1.\n\nThe shifts in the security situation along the Maiduguri-Damasak road (impacting Magumeri, Gubio and Mobbar LGAs), the Maiduguri-Monguno road (impacting primarily Nganzai LGA) and the Maiduguri-Bama road (impacting primarily Konduga LGA) has resulted in a significant reduction in humanitarian access. Reduced services in these areas as well as the possibility of increased hostilities is likely to create additional population movements, including into Maiduguri, over the coming weeks and months. These developments underline the importance of swiftly identifying additional land and securing permission to establish shelters and facilities for newly arriving displaced persons in and around Maiduguri.\n\nSeasonal rains and windstorms have caused significant damage in northeast Nigeria, especially in camps or camp-like settings that are prone to flooding and have poor drainage facilities. An estimated 21,056 households have been affected in the three states, with the worst damages reported in Borno (MMC/Jere, Monguno, Gwoza and Dikwa LGAs) and in Adamawa (Yola South and Yola North LGAs). The high degree of overcrowding, poor hygiene practices, and destruction of WASH infrastructure are leading to increased risk of contracting diseases. About half of those affected have lost their emergency shelter or have experienced partial shelter damage, and the majority require household supplies, food items, water purification, latrine repairs, hygiene kits, and other WASH services. Approximately 500 latrines and bathing facilities have been damaged or destroyed by wind and rains to date. The rainy season is expected to continue into September. UNICEF is coordinating with WASH partners in the affected locations and standing by to provide supplies (especially chlorine and WASH kits) as well as rehabilitation or damaged facilities.\n\nCholera cases continue to be observed in Adamawa state, with a cumulative total of 665 cholera cases and 4 deaths (CFR 0.66%) in 17 wards within 3 LGAs (Yola North, Yola South, and Girei). A number of LGAs in Borno, especially Maiduguri Metropolitan Area and Jere, have seen an increase in the number of cases of acute watery diarrhoea, though overall the number of cases and associated mortality remains significantly lower than during the outbreak last year.",

The Oxford vaccine, which is being developed in the United Kingdom, shows that the vaccine is effective and that perfecting the dose could increase protection up to 90%. This vaccine will be one of the easiest vaccines to distribute in South Sudan, particularly in countries with a tropical climate, because it does require cold storage. (Source: BBC, 2020).\n\nAs Chuol John, journalist at the Voice of Reconciliation, writes in the pandemic post section of this newsletter: health authorities in South Sudan are working hard to secure the vaccine. Dr. Joseph Wamala, the WHO\u2019s Country Preparedness and International Health Regulation officer, he writes, calls the vaccine development encouraging news. However, Dr. Wamala warns that it will take time for the first doses to arrive in South Sudan and advises the public to continue practicing social distancing and wearing face masks. Vice President Madam Rebecca Nyandeng launched the Africa Mask Week initiative with the Ministry of Health, WHO, Africa CDC, African Union Office of the Youth Envoy and other partners (Source: MOH).\n\nInternews media partners continue to address misperceptions about COVID-19 and expressed concern about on-going wrestling competitions in Lakes, Central Equatoria and Jonglei State, as they saw thousands of spectators gather without observing public health measures.

Since DTM\u2019s last update on 29 April, an additional 1,725 displaced families (approximately 8,625\n\nindividuals) were identified. Currently, over 3,330 migrants in detention centers in Tripoli and nearby areas are also considered to be at high risk of being affected by the conflict.\n\nMost IDP families have been identified in different neighborhoods and suburbs of Tripoli, as well as in the areas along the coastal line of western Libya and the Nafusa mountains. IDPs displaced to areas in proximity of areas with ongoing clashes remain at risk, along with host community members currently providing them with shelter. Please refer to pages 3-4 of this report for further details on location disaggregated figures.\n\nOn 25 April 2019, a DTM Rapid Assessment of markets and availability of services was conducted in the affected municipalities of Abusliem, Hai Alandalus, Janzour, Khallat al\n\nFurjan, Salah Eddin, Qasr Bin Ghasheer, Swani Bin Adam, and Tajoura. The rapid assessment was conducted via key informant interviews, and the questions were based on proxy indicators aimed at understanding the impact of conflict on the availability of food, access\n\nto markets and cash, and availability of services. For a summary of the rapid assessment\u2019s findings please refer to page 2.\n\nAT LEAST\n\n(10,110 FAMILIES)\n\nDisplacement timeline as per the cumulative number of IDPs tracked by DTM since the beginning of ongoing Tripoli clashes. dtmlibya@iom.int www.globaldtm.info/libya\n\nDTM RAPID ASSESSMENT\n\nDTM conducted a rapid assessment on the impact of conflict on availability of food, access to markets & cash as well as availability of\n\nservices in the neighborhoods of Abusliem, Hai Alandalus, Janzour, Khallat\n\nal Furjan, Salah Eddin, Qasr Bin Ghasheer, Swani Bin Adam, and Tajoura.\n\nFood security and markets in the assessed municipalities were reported\n\nto be adversely affected by the ongoing armed conflict. In only two of the assessed neighborhoods (Hai Alandalus and Abusliem) it was reported that most of the grocery stores and supermarkets were open, while for all\n\nof the remaining municipalities assessed grocery stores and supermarkets were reported to be negatively affected to varying degrees (Fig. 2).

New and protracted IDPs share the same urgent needs, in an area that has limited shelter options and where the fighting has caused the destruction of civilian infrastruc- ture, including health facilities, schools, bakeries, and has disrupted the provision of basic services. With the Syrian Pound losing value in comparison to other currencies, with an increase in hostilities, and with harsh weather conditions that have been severely damaging IDPs\u2019 shelter and properties, the population is now facing more difficulties in addressing their basic needs.\n\nFor more than two weeks in January, continuous rains and floods affected over 140,000 IDPs, putting a strain on the limited resources available.\n\nOn 11 July 2020, the UN Security Council Resolution that enables the cross-border humanitarian response was renewed again for twelve months until 10 July 2021, although this time trans-shipments are allowed only through one border crossing, Bab Al-Hawa.\n\nAs the number of positive COVID-19 cases rises slowly, access to health and adequate sanitation in the con- text of continuous displacement remains limited across the region, the humanitarian community is actively operating to deliver lifesaving assistance while ensuring the safety of the people.\n\nFollowing the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2165, UNHCR established its cross-border ac- tivities from southern Turkey in July 2014. In 2021, through its own programme, UNHCR has partnerships with six organizations - ACTED, BDC, SEMA, Shafak, SRD and Watan - to assist displaced people by provid- ing core relief items (CRIs), shelter support, and protection services. In addition, UNHCR is co-leading the Protection, Shelter/Non-Food Items (Shelter/NFI) and Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) Clusters. All Clusters closely follow the humanitarian developments in the conflict areas in north-west Syria and contribute to emergency preparedness response plans accordingly.\n\nResponse updates\n\nUNHCR Programme\n\nIn 2021, in coordination with its partners and other humanitarian actors, UNHCR continues to provide basic assistance and protection services to IDPs and conflict-affected vulnerable host community members in north-west Syria under the cross-border operation from Gaziantep, Turkey. The response was scaled up in 2020 to serve the urgent humanitarian needs of the population in the region, who has been severely affected by the ongoing hostilities, inad- equate shelter conditions and a deteriorating eco- nomic situation, and continued despite the limitation of having only one border crossing through which deliver humanitarian assistance.",

This results in around more than 20,000 displaced population. (about 4,500 households according to OCHA).\n\nMore than 195,000 people, according to the WASH cluster3, might have difficulty in accessing safe water due to a disabled water reservoir and 25,000 persons had already their water access cut off, while access to electricity was cut off in large parts of Goma city. Seven schools (five primary schools4 and two secondary schools) have been affected. 1,957 students and 49 teachers have been affected at primary school level and while 447 students and 72 teachers are affected at secondary school level5. It has also been reported that 38 health centers (including ten in Goma Health Zone, 19 in Karisimbi Health Zone and nine in Nyiragongo Health Zone) have been affected by the volcanic eruption6.\n\nBetween 3,000 and 5,000 people crossed the border into Rwanda from Goma, while at least 25,000 were displaced in Sake on 22 May7. From 23 May, a large majority of the displaced people from Sake and Rwanda have started make their way back home to Goma. The returnees have found damaged houses and water and electricity shortages.\n\nSource: OCHA, Sitrep #2, May 26, 2021 Source: OCHA Sitrep #2, May 26, 2021 Source: WASH Cluster, Joint Needs Assessment Report, May 25 2021 Four primary schools and equipment have been destroyed by the lava flows while one is occupied by IDPs (Internally Displaced Person). Source: UNICEF, 25 May 2021 Source: UNICEF, 25 May 2021 Source: UNICEF and Red Cross joint needs assessment, 23 May 2021.\n\nThere is also risk that the displacement to Sake through Nyiragongo, an area prone to cholera outbreaks where at least 19 suspected cases have been recorded in the last two weeks and where positivity rates show one of the most dynamic cholera transmissions in eastern DRC, might increase the spread of cholera to new areas, and cause major risk of cholera epidemic resumption in the urban area of Goma, as people are heading home again. Eventually, there is a concern of food supply, considering that the road between Goma and Rutshuru has been cut off following the eruption. Airport of Goma and Bukavu are closed, limiting logistics access.\n\nDuring the evacuation on the day of eruption, many children have gone missing. As of 26 May, 939 non-accompanied children have been identified, of which 686 non-accompanied children have been reunified, while 142 children have been placed in transitional foster families, 78 children are in transit accommodation centers and more than 170 families are still looking for lost\n\nThe increasingly frequent seismic activities, which began on 23 May and are predicted to continue for the next days or weeks, also constitute a concern, in that it will weaken the structure of the houses, some of which have already started to collapse, and thus make the humanitarian situation worse, while causing further stress on a population that is already traumatized.\n\nDuring the night of 27 May, the government decided to evacuate ten neighbourhoods (Majengo, Mabanga Nord, Mabanga Sud, Bujovu, Virunga, Murara, Mapendo, Mikeno, Kayembe, Le Volcan) towards Sake, thus increasing the humanitarian risks. Indeed, this evacuation will mean the displacement of approximately 400,000 people including 282,000 children and should have far- reaching consequences in terms of NFI (Non-Food Item), child protection, risks related to cholera, health and nutrition. Depending on the situation evolution, the humanitarian consequences will have to be reconsidered for the households that fled their home in evacuated districts.",

The figure includes 271 displaced households currently living in six public schools in Sana\u2019a City. As schools are due to reopen in few weeks, discussions and assessments are underway to move the IDPs to the Olympic Centre dormitory in the Capital.\n\nAl Hudaydah On 10 July, airstrikes reportedly struck two cars that were leaving a local market in Al Garrahi District, killing six civilians, including a 14-year-old boy. During the reporting period, displacement within Al Hudaydah Governorate and to neighbouring governorates continued. As of 17 July, 33,354 displaced households have been verified and 20,856 have received assistance.\n\nAs of 17 July, 30 displaced households from Al Hudaydah Governorate have been verified in Sa\u2019ada and Al Jawf governorates and 17 of them have received assistance. WFP is supporting treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) cases in 114 health facilities in Sa\u2019ada Governorate, in addition to 23 health facilities in Bart Al Anan and Rajuzah districts in Al Jawf Governorate. UNICEF has signed agreements to\n\nimplement five water projects in al Jawf Governorate, benefiting some 58,000 people.\n\nAs of 17 July, some 4,000 displaced households from Al Hudaydah Governorate have been verified and 1,367 have received assistance. During the reporting period, WHO dispatched medical supplies to Taizz City to support Al-Thawrah and Al Jumhori hospitals in providing 5,000 renal dialysis sessions.\n\nAs of 17 July, 2,360 displaced households from Al Hudaydah Governorate have been verified and some 2,075 have been assisted. Displaced households located in areas between Lahj and Taizz governorates have been difficult to reach due to the proximity to an active front line.\n\nAn earthquake measuring 5.4 on the Richter scale hit the coast of Hadramaut and Al Mahrah Governorates in the early hours of 15 July. The quake occurred 213 kilometres northwest of the island of Socotra, at a depth of 10 km. No reports of any damage or injuries were reported.\n\nIOM RESUMES VOLUNTARY RETURNS FROM YEMEN\n\nOn Thursday 12 July, IOM, the UN Migration Agency, organized the voluntary return of 53 Ethiopian migrants from Yemen. A ship transported the 48 men and 5 boys from Al Hudaydah Seaport to Djibouti, where they were received by IOM staff who coordinated their onward journey.\n\nEvery year, thousands of migrants from East and West Africa travel to Yemen, some seeking employment and long-term settlement, others looking to reach Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. The vast majority of migrants are unaware of the conflict in Yemen. However, once in the country, many of them are left stranded and destitute, with little means of support and no way to return home.\n\nIOM provides vulnerable migrants with essential life-saving humanitarian assistance, including food and water, medical assistance and hygiene items. In addition, IOM also provides shelter, medical referrals to\n\nCredit: IOM\n\nlocal hospitals and psychosocial support to migrants who experienced abuse at the hands of smugglers. IOM also supports migrants with its assisted voluntary return programme and reintegration support at home. To date, IOM has assisted over 483 Ethiopian migrants with return assistance out of Al Hudaydah, and 1,205 Somali refugees out of Aden Seaport.\n\nMID-YEAR UPDATE FROM UNHAS\n\nFrom January to June 2018, UNHAS has operated 177 flights and transported 4,837 passengers. A total of 42 cargo flights were operated and some 2,404 tons of cargo were airlifted. In January, UNHAS operated its first direct flight between Aden and Sana\u2019a, without the usual stop-over in Djibouti. Starting from August 2018, the direct flight will be operated as a regular route.\n\nSource: UNHAS UNVIM UPDATE During the period from 4 to 17 July 2018, nine vessels discharged 192,485 MT of cargo at Yemen\u2019s Red Sea ports of Al Hudaydah and Saleef. 61 per cent of the cargo was imported through Al Hudaydah port and 39 per cent through Saleef port.",

    "text": "1564\n\n21 - 27 April 2018\n\nUNHCR FLASH UPDATE\n\nUNHCR is responding to the urgent humanitarian situation of around 800 refugees and migrants who are detained in the Zwara detention centre (115 km west of Tripoli). On 25 April, UNHCR and its partner International Medical Corps (IMC) visited the facility, provided medical assistance, and dispatched non-food items for 800 refugees and migrants in detention. UNHCR, MSF and DRC are conducting an anti-scabies campaign inside the detention facility. Due to the fact that the coastal road between Zwara and Tripoli is too dangerous, in coordination with the authorities, UNHCR is exploring the evacuation of all persons of concern (Eritreans, Somali and Sudanese) from Zwara to Tripoli by airplane, logistics and security permitting.\n\nPopulation Movements\n\nAs of 26 April 2018, 5,109 refugees and migrants were rescued/intercepted migrants were disembarked in Tripoli (322 individuals), Zwara (111 individuals), Azzawya (82 individuals) and Al Khums (94 individuals). On the 22 April, a shipwreck took place near Sabratha (75 km west of Tripoli) causing the loss of at least 11 lives at sea. The remaining 82 survivors were disembarked in Azzawya. Humanitarian and medical assistance was provided by UNHCR and its partner IMC at all disembarkation points where the most vulnerable cases were identified. In line with recent trends, boats departed from areas near Zwara and Garabulli.\n\nUNHCR Response\n\nOn 24 April, UNHCR conducted a protection monitoring visit to two settlements in Misrata where over 14,000 persons are currently displaced (IDPs). UNHCR and its partner LibAid led focus group discussions with men, women and the elderly to identify their needs and work towards providing solutions for them. The main needs raised include the lack of health care and medicines, and reduced access to civil documentation. Many new-born IDPs have no access to birth registration. The majority of IDPs are facing dire living conditions with limited income. During the visit, UNHCR distributed 300 hygiene kits to women and girls living in the settlements.\n\nOn 25 April, UNHCR evacuated two unaccompanied children from Misrata, Libya, to Switzerland, as part of family reunification efforts to reunite the children with their mother. UNHCR appreciates the cooperation with authorities in Libya, Tunis and Switzerland, who facilitated the departure and safe arrival of two refugee children to Switzerland. The children were identified by UNHCR during its registration activities in Karareem detention centre in Misrata (200 km east of Tripoli) in February.\n\nSpecial thanks to our donors: Australia | Denmark | European Union | Germany | Italy | The Netherlands | Norway | Sweden | Switzerland | United Kingdom\n\nKey Figures people of concern 51,519 registered refugees & asylum-seekers 184,612* internally displaced persons\n\nUNHCR Coordinated Sectors\n\nShelter & NFI Sector Cash & Markets Working Group\n\nKey Achievements in 2018\n\n13,581 35,091 in 2017) 21,416 IDPs and refugees received non-food items (113,605 in 2017)\n\n2,705 IDP and refugee households received cash assistance (3,314 in 2017)\n\n15,021 individuals registered since 2016 (6,860 in 2018)\n\n3,134 rescue kits and 488 medical\n\n(5,327 and 2,956 in 2017) 451 monitoring visits to (1,080 in 2017)\n\n1,006 detained refugees/asylum-seekers released (1,428 in 2017)\n\n1,807 refugees and asylum-seekers reached with submissions to third countries and 1,342 individuals evacuated from Libya ( 1,020 to Niger, 312 to Italy and 10 to Romania)\n\nLorem ipsum\n\nUNHCR Funding Requirements\n\nUSD 85 million required in 2018 for Libya emergency response\n\n* IOM-DTM",

    "text": "21794\n\nIn June, the number of refugees and migrants from Venezuela reached the 4 million worldwide, with 3.2 million hosted in Latin America and the\n\n4 Million Venezuelans worldwide\n\nThe financial contributions towards the RMRP reached a 21% of the total requirements in June. A still low funding percentage towards the USD 737.6M requested in the Plan.\n\nNew entry requirements were implemented by Chile and Peru, while registration exercises took place in Trinidad and Tobago and\n\n3.2 Million Venezuelans living in Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nPage 1 of 6\n\nRegional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform > Situation Report \u2013 May/June 2019\n\nArea of Intervention 1: Direct emergency assistance Strategic outcome: Refugees and migrants are provided with life-saving goods and services.\n\nNeeds Assessments\n\nMonitoring exercises were conducted in Ecuador in partnership with the Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion (MIES). Results indicate that almost 40% of the 1,682 Venezuelan national interviewees report being in an irregular situation, while more than 37% indicated having a tourist visa or a \u201ctarjeta andina\u201d. The proportion of out-of-school children reported was of 41% of children aged between 5 to 11 and 53% of those aged 12 to 17 years.\n\nBasic Needs and Essential Services\n\nPartners have provided assistance to more than 8,000 refugees and migrants from Venezuela in Peru, Guyana, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, Argentina, Uruguay, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nTransportation assistance was provided to over 5,500 refugees and migrants from the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border to CEBAF and Tumbes, where approximately one fifth were referred to shelter support. More than 11,000 food and non- food kits were also provided in Peru.\n\nIn the area of food and nutrition, partners in the Caribbean (Guyana, Aruba, Curacao and Trinidad and Tobago) reached approximately 1,300 refugees and migrants from Venezuela with basic food and/or water. Temporary accommodation was also provided to 96 vulnerable refugees and migrants in Curacao, Dominican Republic, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. In the Southern Cone (Argentina and Uruguay), on the other hand, almost 40 refugees and migrants from Venezuela were provided with temporary accommodation and food assistance.\n\nHealth Services\n\nThe provision of emergency health services and assistance is a pressing need among Venezuelans across the region. In the Dominican Republic, 562 Venezuelans benefitted from individual medical consultations. In Guyana, 787 Venezuelans were immunized and vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), Yellow Fever and diphtheria before being granted stay permits. In Trinidad and Tobago, partners distributed 14 dignity kits to 13 Venezuelan and one Cuban woman, and 97 Venezuelans (75 women, 1 girl and 21 men) accessed sexual reproductive health services. In Panama, partners provided medicines (along with food vouchers and housing support) to 16 Venezuelan families, 73 persons received psychosocial assistance.\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\nRegional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform > Situation Report \u2013 May/June 2019\n\nOrientation and Information\n\nIn Costa Rica, information was provided regarding the possibility for migrant and refugee children to access to the national education system. Among these, partners selected 20 Venezuelan children - based on vulnerability criteria - and provided them with uniforms and school supplies. Partners also provided tutoring and academic support to primary and secondary students to help them enter the Costa Rican educational system.\n\nIn Mexico, partners launched an information campaign called \u201cConnecting Communities\u201d through social media sites. It included information on how to obtain work permits, carry out family reunification, access to basic education and revalidating academic degrees. The campaign is estimated to have reached an audience of over 90,000 persons.\n\nArea of Intervention 2: Protection Strategic outcome: Refugees and migrants enjoy rights and protection.",

UNHCR is following with concern the unfolding of events and the resulting surge in humanitarian and protection needs. While UNHCR continues to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and for all parties to adhere to their obligations under International Humanitarian Law, the UNHCR-led Protection Cluster\u2019s Civilian Impact Monitoring Project reported two incidents in September, targeting a fishing community and which resulted in 22 civilian casualties.\n\nSince the onset of the Al Hudaydah Offensive in June 2018, more than 76,500 households have been internally displaced. UNHCR assisted some 100,000 people as part of the Al Hudaydah response, and will continue to scale-up as more civilians flee their homes and humanitarian and protection needs grow. In parallel, strengthening the protection response for persons of concern, including through the expansion of UNHCR\u2019s cash assistance programme, remains a priority.\n\nThe impact of the Yemeni Riyal\u2019s rapid devaluation sparks civil unrest and compounds coping abilities of persons of concern. In a country where most food is imported, the population is losing its ability to purchase basic food items due to the steep devaluation of the currency. UNHCR\u2019s multi-purpose cash distributions enable persons of concern to meet their families\u2019 most basic needs during this time of crisis. Without adequate financial support, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees alike are exposed to increased protection risks (such as exploitation), and resort to negative coping mechanisms (such as begging, child labour and early\n\nIDP Response\n\nThe recent escalation in hostilities in Al Hudaydah resulted in the displacement of 500 families. UNHCR observed displacement from villages in Ad Durayhimi District into Al Hudaydah city. On 16 September, UNHCR\u2019s partner JAAHD commenced a needs assessment of families displaced from Al Hudaydah to Asukhna, Bajel and Al-Mansoria districts. Furthermore, in Ibb Governorate, UNHCR and its partner the Yemen Women\u2019s Union distributed core-relief items (CRIs) to some 450 displaced families from Al\n\nAs part of the Al Hudaydah response, since June, UNHCR and its partners conducted protection monitoring assessments of over 57,000 households. The assessments have allowed UNHCR and partners to determine displaced persons\u2019 emergency shelter and protection needs. The Agency also continues to distribute CRIs and emergency shelter kits (ESKs) to families in areas of displacement and is offering protection services, such as legal assistance and psychosocial counselling in eight IDP community centres countrywide. Since June, UNHCR has reached 100,000 IDPs through the Al Hudaydah response.\n\nResponding to the growing needs, UNHCR distributed much needed cash assistance to some 22,000 families (140,000 individuals) in August alone. The value of the cash assistance disbursed totalled over two billion Yemeni Riyals (some four million US Dollars). Given their pressing shelter needs, some 73 percent of the cash assistance was disbursed for use by IDPs as rental subsidies. In September, UNHCR also started cash distribution activities for CRIs, targeting nearly 1,800 displaced families in Aden and Lahj Governorates. Some 600 families already received the \u2018Cash for CRIs\u2019 and another 927 families in Aden, Lahj and Al Hudaydah Governorates have been referred to UNHCR for similar assistance.\n\nIn preparation for the 2018/19 school year, UNHCR, in cooperation with local authorities, progressed with vacating nine schools in Sana\u2019a that used to host some 300 displaced families from Al Hudaydah. Six of the nine schools were vacated, and protection assessments were conducted to assess the IDPs\u2019 imminent needs. So far, UNHCR provided",

In the wake of the first attacks on Niger soil in 2015, the situation has dramatically deteriorated. In May 2015, the authorities decided to evacuate the population living in the Niger region of the Lake Chad Islands.\n\nSince April 2019, movements are restricted on the Gueskerou, Toumour and Bosso roads following the finding of explosive devices, consecutive attacks and kidnappings.\n\nIn January 2021, the security situation remained worrying in the Diffa region due to terrorist activism despite government efforts to stabilize the administrative and security situation, making the humanitarian access to certain areas difficult.

    "text": "43576\n\n********* [PAGE 1 START] *********\n\nThere were 11,891 children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) admitted into a treatment programme August. There appears to be a slight reduction in SAM admissions compared to previous months, consistent with historical seasonal patterns. In August, UNICEF and implementing partners provided essential health services via health facilities and re-instated outreach services to 34,426 children under-5 and 22,056 women. UNICEF supported the provision of emergency water reaching 52,000 vulnerable people in Lower Shabelle and Lower Juba regions who were affected by the Hagaa floods. This included 34,000 people through water trucking and 18,000 people had access to safe water after chlorination of 50 water points in the affected areas. A total of 116,612 children were supported with alternative learning such as radio, television and online eLearning. This was aimed at aimed at ensuring continuity of learning in the COVID-19 context. In August, 220 student Social Workers facilitated rights based public outreach and awareness raising on risk education, prevention of family separation, COVID-19 precautionary measures, child recruitment, child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) which reached 7,306 people.\n\nUNICEF\u2019s Response and Funding Status\n\nUNICEF Appeal 2020 US$ 129 million\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nFunding Overview and Partnerships In 2020, UNICEF is appealing for US$ 129.1 million to sustain provision of life-saving services including critical nutrition, health, WASH, child protection and education in emergency interventions, as well as cash-based assistance for women and children in Somalia. Continued predictable, flexible and timely donor support is critical to sustaining vital response activities and preventing further deterioration of the situation. The contributions made in 2020 will enable UNICEF and partners to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale as a result of droughts, floods and conflict.\n\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Needs The impact of the triple threat of floods, desert locusts and COVID-19 has been estimated to have put 5.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2020, with an estimated 3.5 million (1 million children) people projected to fall into crisis or emergency food insecurity1. Whilst most of the people who were displaced in the flooding in July have since returned to their homes there were new areas flooded in August. The flood waters impacted the southern areas of Somalia with over 15,000 people displaced in Belet Weyne due to overbank spillage of water later in August2. This flooding was as a result of late Hagaa rains being heavier than in previous years resulting in breakages in riverbanks and damages to houses and farmlands with crops. Since late June over 250,000 people have been affected by floods in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states. Humanitarian partners (including UNICEF) have responded to the flooding with distributions of WASH and NFI supplies as well as food assistance. Compounding the impact of the floods, the desert locust plague, is showing signs of effecting the overall food security within the country3. In late August a measles and polio vaccination campaign were started to immunize close to 460,000 children under 5 years of age. The campaign aims to reduce the occurrence of measles outbreaks in Somalia.\n\nSummary Analysis of Programme Response\n\nDuring the month of August, the emergency nutrition programme focused on the most fragile areas of Somalia with coverage of programmes critical to accelerate the reduction and prevention of excess morbidity and mortality related to severe acute malnutrition (SAM). As such, 159,993 children with SAM (45 per cent of whom are boys) have been admitted into the SAM treatment programme since January, 11,891 of which were admitted in August. Although the case load for 2020 has exceeded the target there is sufficient supplies in stock to cover the projected needs until March 2021. After accounting for reporting lags, there still appears to be a slight reduction in SAM admissions compared to previous months, consistent with historical seasonal patterns. Overall, the trend is consistent with, and numbers are lower than, in 2019. In September there will be the Gu assessment analysis which will be used to guide the needs for the humanitarian response plan (HRP) in 2021. The highest admissions are registered in Afgooye, Baidoa and Belet Weyne denoting the impact of the floods that have significantly affected riverine cropping areas of Middle Shabelle, Hiraan, Middle and Lower Juba. UNICEF has reached 600,000 pregnant and lactating women with appropriate infant and young child feeding (IYCF) counselling since January. In August, UNICEF supported the World Breastfeeding week through a variety of activities that promote, protect and support breastfeeding including 210 radio spots aired by five radio stations, radio talk shows, 105 TV spots aired three times a day and SMS on breastfeeding to about 20,000 mobile subscribers. Moving forward, the nutrition program will sustain the integrated response and adjust the response to reach children most in need in line with global standards.",

    "text": "47081\n\nGIEWS Country Brief\n\nReference Date: 04-January-2021\n\ninsecure in 2020 post\u2011harvest period\n\nSlightly above-average cereal production gathered in 2020\n\nHarvesting activities of millet, sorghum, rainfed rice and main season maize crops have almost finalized, while harvesting of irrigated rice and second season maize crops is still ongoing and will be completed by end-January. Despite the conflict in the northern areas and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, favourable rains in 2020 benefitted crop development in most parts of the country. The country\u2019s aggregate cereal output in 2020 is estimated at 28 million tonnes, slightly above the last five-year average, but below the 2019 production record.\n\nEarly and extended rainfall favoured abundant quality pasture and water resources for livestock in the main grazing areas of the country. Crop residues from the main harvest are also increasing fodder availability in most parts of the country. The national forage production in dry matter content is estimated at about 6.3 million tonnes, 7 percent above the last five-year average. The animal health situation is generally favourable, with only seasonal disease outbreaks recorded in some areas, including Contagious Bovine Pleuroneumonia (CBPP), Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), African Swine Fever (ASF), Gumboro (Infectious Bursal Disease - IBD), New Castle Disease (NCD) and Helminthiasis. However, the persisting conflict in northern areas and clashes between farmers and pastoralist in northcentral and northwestern areas continue to limit the access to grazing resources and herds started earlier than usual to move southwards in January. In addition, pastoralist transhumance from Niger, Chad and Cameroon is expected to remain significantly limited due to border closures, persistent conflict and cattle rustling incidences, theft and banditry along the borders.\n\nCereal import requirements estimated slightly above average in 2020/21 marketing year\n\nIn addition to the trade restrictions introduced in 2015 to increase local production, the Government decided to close the borders since August 2019 in order to stop illegal inflows of rice and maize from neighboring countries, with the aim to accelerate domestic crop production. However, the country continues to rely significantly on imports of crops, including rice and wheat, to cover its domestic requirements. The aggregate import requirement of cereals in the 2020/21 marketing year (November/October) is estimated at 7.25 million tonnes, slightly above the five-year average and similar to the previous year\u2019s\n\nPrices ease with new supplies from recent harvest, but remain at high levels\n\nPrices of coarse grains started their seasonal decline in October due to the arrival on the markets of new supplies from the 2020 harvest. However, prices remained at high levels and were higher than their year-earlier values, mainly due the effects of the measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chain and the unfavourable macro-economic conditions, including the high inflation rate and the continued depreciation of the local currency. The situation is compounded by localized production deficits, coupled with the strong domestic demand to supply local factories for beverages and animal feed production. In addition, the situation is exacerbated by the persisting conflict in the northeast part of the country, where prices were up to twice their year-earlier values.\n\nWeak economic growth projected, food price inflation increasing\n\nThe economic recession continues in the country, characterized by a negative growth rate of 6.10 percent in the second quarter and 3.62 percent in the third quarter of 2020. Current macro-economic conditions are mainly driven by the low global crude oil prices on the international market and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, the food inflation rate has progressively increased since late 2019, reaching 18.3 percent in November 2020, the highest level in about three years. Moreover, the Naira continued to depreciate from NGN 461/US dollar in October 2020 to NGN 482/US dollar in November 2020. The situation is also exacerbated by recent social protests, further limiting economic activities.",

Afghanistan and Nepal have received consignments of COVID-19 vaccine doses (468,000 and 348,000 doses respectively) through the COVAX facility.\n\nSouth-West Asia\n\n\u2022 Afghanistan has received 968,000 doses (500,000 doses from India and 468,000 doses received through COVAX) and vaccinated 484,000 persons. The World Bank has also approved USD 60 million from the International Development Association to help Afghanistan purchase COVID-19 vaccines, as well as additional financing of USD 113 million, which will help reach more than 17% of Afghans. Further support from the Asian Development Bank is expected to fund the purchase of vaccines for an additional 11% of the Afghan people. \u2022 7 out of 11 COVID-19 cases in Afghanistan detected a new variant, which is reportedly more contagious. Commercial domestic and international flights nonetheless continue to operate. Borders have also remained open and enabled the implementation of activities under the Voluntary Repatriation programme. \u2022 Of the 300,000 disposable face masks donated to Afghanistan by the Republic of Korea, UNHCR handed 150,000 masks on 28 March to the Ministry of Public Health for professionals and workers in isolation wards, ICU units and laboratories in isolation centres. The remaining 150,000 face masks will be distributed to vulnerable refugees, displaced persons and host communities across the country.\n\nIslamic Republic of Iran \u2022 On 10 March, at a joint meeting attended by UNHCR, UNICEF, WHO, MoH, MFA and BAFIA, the Government reconfirmed its commitment to include foreigners (including refugees and undocumented\n\nAfghans) in the national COVID vaccination drive. However, there are challenges with availability and supply of vaccines to Iran, and efforts will be made by concerned parties to secure vaccines. Refugee children continue to study from home in Iran. To address the lack of ICT equipment, UNHCR procured 21,500 tablets and is working with the Government on a distribution plan.\n\n\u2022 The inclusion of refugees in the Government\u2019s vaccination program has been confirmed. The first meeting of the Technical Working Group for refugee inclusion was held on 5 March. The Government indicated that the PoR card could be used in the registration system instead of the national identity card number used by Pakistani nationals. A strategy to vaccinate the unregistered population will be discussed once the vaccination for the eligible PoR card holders is completed. \u2022 The National Command and Operation Centre stepped up the vaccination drive and imposed stricter measures across the country to control the spike in infections during the third wave of the pandemic. According to the Government, some 800,000 doses of the vaccine have been administered. \u2022 The Documentation Renewal and Identity Verification Exercise (DRIVE) in Pakistan, which was due to commence on 1 April, was postponed to 15 April due to the worsening COVID-19 situation in the country. A press release announcing the postponement was issued, and messages, including audio\n\nrecordings in Dari, Pashto and Urdu, were posted on social media and/or transmitted by WhatsApp to refugee networks.\n\nThe Humanitarian Response Plan is in the final stages of agreement with the Government. The refugee chapter remains relatively unchanged but a separate chapter has been included to provide focused support for Afghan Citizen Card Holders and Undocumented Afghans.\n\nCentral Asia\n\n\u2022 COVID-19 has been officially included into the list of guaranteed free medical assistance for foreigners in Kazakhstan, including refugees, asylum-seekers and stateless persons. Starting 5 April, refugees in Almaty registered by the Government will have access to COVID vaccination. UNHCR and partners continue to advocate for the inclusion of all persons of concern (POCs) in national COVID vaccination",

    "text": "49573\n\nHEALTH SITUATION\n\nCOVID-19 update On 31 December 2020, the Government of Chad issued a decree closing the land borders of the city of\n\nN\u2019Djamena for a week starting 1 January, with a stricter curfew from 6pm to 5am. Schools and universities, places of worship, bars, restaurants, markets are closed. On 4 January the air borders were closed to travelers. Public or private gatherings of people in groups larger than 10 are prohibited, and urban and interurban transport is forbidden. Health centers and food shops remain open and cargo flights are permitted. A minimum service is guaranteed for banks, public and private essential services, mobile telephone companies and oil stations. These restrictions apply within N\u2019Djamena with the boundaries defined as east of N\u2019Djamena-Koura, west of Mara, south of Koundoul and north of Djermaya.\n\nOn 7 January, the restrictions were renewed for a further week, with the curfew slightly adjusted to 7pm until 5am and the size of gatherings now permitted increased to 50. On 6 January, the Minister of Public Health and National Solidarity announced relief measures for the population most affected by the lockdown. The director of the National Office of Food Security (ONASA) was tasked with distributing food stocks to identified vulnerable people. He urged the help of local partners such as the Chadian Red Cross in distribution operations.\n\nAs of 5 January, there have been 2,328 reported cases and 105 deaths in 17 provinces. Since the issuance of the new decree on 31 December, 119 cases have been reported in the capital: mostly contact cases and travelers. (Government of Chad, WHO situational reports and press)\n\nINTERCOMMUNAL CONFLICT\n\nUpdate on intercommunal conflict: Between 1 and 2 January, several fields were damaged by grazing cattle in the localities of Djokhana and Abourakha, Mouraye district (Salamat province). This resulted in clashes between herders and farmers and led to numerous casualties. A number of cattle were also killed. As of 5 January, sources report 17 dead and eight wounded, currently in treatment at Am-Timan hospital. No population movement has been reported. The situation remains tense and Defence and Security Forces are still deployed. Since December 2020, 60 people have been killed due to intercommunal clashes across the country and more than 30 have been wounded. Additionally, these incidents have caused severe damage to fields and crops, leading to greater needs in food for affected populations. OCHA continues to closely monitor the situation with local authorities and\n\npartners. (press and UNDSS)\n\nMayo-Kebbi est Deadly intercommunal conflict: On 5 January, a clash between herders and farmers took place in the locality of Kim, after a farmer saw his harvest destroyed by the cattle of a herder around his field. As a result of the incident, three people were killed and two wounded, as reported in the press and confirmed by UNDSS. Defence and Security Forces have been deployed from Bongor and have restored calm in the area after arresting the perpetrator of the crime.

We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nOCHA operational updates | 2\n\nNew Chadian deportees from Libya need humanitarian assistance: Between 31 December 2020 and 4 January 2021, 88 Chadian nationals (including 81 men, two women and five girls) arrived in the town of Ounianga K\u00e9bir following their deportation from Libya. IOM used to provide humanitarian assistance to deported individuals during their quarantine in Ounianga Kebir but its funds ran out at the end of December 2020 and, despite multiple approaches, no donor has yet come forward with new funds. There are concerns that, unless local authorities themselves are able to provide this assistance, quarantine measures will be difficult to enforce. Since mid-April 2020, IOM has reported 1,108 people deported from Libya to Ounianga Kebir. These people arrive in Chad in a state of great vulnerability and with urgent needs in food, water and NFIs.

    "text": "38718\n\nBANGLADESH / REFUGEE SITUATION\n\n1-15 July 2020 COVID-19 Response\n\nBangladesh medical and support staff working in different facilities supported by UNHCR in Cox\u2019s Bazar are making a huge difference to the lives of refugees and the host community in the areas adjacent to camps. Through their professionalism and courage, they are offering COVID-19 patients and their families hope. Photo: \u00a9UNHCR\n\nAs of 15 July, WHO reported over 3,084 cases of COVID-19 in Cox\u2019s Bazar, including a number of front-line\n\nhealthcare staff and humanitarian staff. 58 refugees have tested positive for COVID-19, and six have sadly died to date. Testing in the camps has increased significantly as a result of the efforts of Community Health Worker\n\nvolunteers who are engaged in enhanced community-based surveillance and offering targeted counselling for refugees identified with COVID-like symptoms, including explanations on testing.\n\nTo date, over 150 people were treated in two UNHCR-supported Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Isolation and Treatment Centres (SARI ITCs) in Ukhiya and Kutupalong in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Patients include refugees and host community members. Some 107 refugees are currently undergoing quarantine in facilities run by UNHCR.\n\nThe Cox\u2019s Bazar municipality was designated as a \u2018Red Zone\u2019 with special measures in place to control the spread of the virus, which were also applied in the areas where refugee settlements are situated. These\n\nlockdown measures have since been eased in Cox\u2019s Bazar town. UNHCR and humanitarian partners continue to exercise care in conducting critical activities in the camps as the risk posed by the virus remains high.\n\nCOVID-19 PREVENTION/PREPAREDNESS Bangladesh Refugee Response\n\nOperational Update on Key Sectors\n\nSARI Isolation and Treatment Centres (ITC) Intensive Care Unit (ICU) ward\n\n\u25a0 2 SARI ITCs fully offering services for refugees and host community (194 beds)\n\n\u25a0 Supporting 10 ICU / 8 High Dependency Beds in Cox\u2019s Bazar District hospital\n\nUNHCR is managing two SARI ITCs, which provide medical care for COVID-19 positive patients from refugee settlements and the host community areas adjacent to them. As of 15 July, 159 patients\n\nhave been admitted to the facilities, of which 31 are currently in-patients; 101 were discharged; as well as some transferred to other facilities and ICU care in Cox\u2019s Bazar.\n\nThe expanded ICU at the local district hospital in Cox\u2019s Bazar started treating patients in late June with the support of UNHCR. UNHCR provides medical equipment and a team of medical and support staff for six months.\n\nCurrently, 107 refugees are under quarantine at four quarantine facilities managed by UNHCR in Ukhiya and Teknaf. These facilities offer space for refugees to stay when they have had close contact with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19.\n\nA new community-based surveillance initiative by UNHCR and WHO that uses existing Community Health Workers (CHWs) has started to show results. More refugees are coming forward for COVID- 19 testing. Some 1,440 CHWs have been trained on identifying patients with mild and moderate respiratory illness symptoms using simple criteria. CHWs offer individual counselling about testing, treatment, and a referral if required, including for quarantine services. As a result of the initiative, CHWs were able to identify over 1,850 refugees with mild respiratory symptoms during the week of July 8th. Over 900 were referred to health facilities and 13 patients were identified with moderate COVID-like symptoms and were tested. The work of the CHWs has contributed to an increase in the uptake of COVID-19 testing.\n\nCHWs also continue to conduct regular health awareness raising, making on average over 130,000 household visits per week (this equates to 250,000 individual refugees approximately). According to the community volunteers, there is a growing understanding among refugees about actions they need to take to remain safe from COVID-19, as well as available support through health facilities.",

    "text": "46162\n\nCHAD Food Security Outlook Update April 2020 The food security situation of Stressed (IPC Phase 2) households is deteriorating due to COVID-19\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n\nFollowing the appearance of COVID-19 in March 2020, the government of Chad initiated countermeasures, including the closure of borders and non-food businesses and restrictions on transport. As a result, the income of very poor and poor households is declining in most parts of the country due to reduced employment opportunities, especially in urban areas.\n\nThese populations are experiencing reduced food consumption and are Stressed (IPC Phase 2). Some more affected households are experiencing consumption shortfalls and may be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).\n\nIn Lac Province there are 272,478 internally displaced persons, 208,382 of whom are internally displaced persons (IDPs). These movements of displaced persons put pressure on the\n\nlivelihoods of host households. Thanks to humanitarian\n\nassistance, their food consumption is minimally adequate, and they cannot spend on non-food items. As a result, these households are Stressed (IPC Phase 2!).\n\nIn Tibesti, a fall in supply as a result of transport restrictions coupled with border closures has led to a moderate rise in market prices. Faced with this trend, low income levels are limiting household access to markets. Their food consumption\n\nis minimally adequate, and they are experiencing Stressed (IPC\n\nPhase 2) levels of food insecurity.\n\nThe supply of agricultural produce to markets in most areas of the country is declining due to higher transport costs. There is a reduction in supply, which is compounded by stock retentions by some traders. However, demand is stable and decreasing, despite Ramadan, as a result of falling household\n\nCURRENT SITUATION\n\nCOVID-19: To limit the spread of the pandemic, the government has introduced several measures, including the closure of borders and non-food shops, transport restrictions and a curfew. These measures have led to a slowdown in socioeconomic activities across all sectors. This is having a huge impact on the livelihoods of very poor and poor households.

In Mayo-Kebbi, COVID-19 measures have banned access to the river islands, which is having a significant impact on the market garden output that feeds the city of N\u2019Djamena. As a result, current harvests are down compared with a normal year, which is likely to affect the income level of very poor and poor households, for whom market produce is an important source of income during this period in a normal year.\n\nPastoral situation: This is characterized by the degradation of pasture and the drying up of pastoral wells in western Sahel. Insecurity in the Lac region is restricting access to pasture in island areas for animals in the regions of Lac and Kanem, which is leading to overgrazing on dry land. During this period of the peak lean season, livestock are being fed with preserved hay, groundnut cake and bran. However, livestock farmers are forced to travel long distances of more than 15 km at night in search of water sources for their animals. In the eastern pastoral area, transhumant herders are still in transhumance areas, such as Sila and Salamat and a little further south, where they have access to water sources and crop residues, as in a normal year. The physical condition of the animals is below that of a normal year, though their health is generally stable. The COVID-19 restrictions are not currently affecting pastoral movements.",

    "text": "67914\n\nCOVID-19 cases continued to surge across Syria. As of 31 August 2021, a total of 27,915 COVID-19 cases, including 2,013 fatalities, were confirmed by the Minister of Health in government-controlled areas. The monthly increase in COVID-19 cases in August (1,952 cases) signals an upward trend compared to July 2021 (488 cases) and represents the highest monthly caseload since May 2021. In August 2021, around 20,611 COVID-19 cases were reported across northeast Syria, an increase of 1,960 new cases compared to the previous month, representing the second highest monthly case- load since December 2020. In opposition-held areas in northwest Syria, the epidemiological situation has significantly deteriorated. Approximately 39,271 COVID-19 cases were reported in north- west Syria by the end of August, an increase of 12,839 new cases compared to the previous month, representing the highest monthly caseload since the start of the pandemic. Simultaneously, as of 23 August 2021, around 218,900 people were vaccinated in government-controlled areas including in northeast Syria, in addition to 58,000 people in northwest Syria. This coverage reflects less than one percent of Syria\u2019s population. On 15 August, a second batch of COVAX vaccines arrived in Syria, about 138,000 jabs for government-controlled areas including in northeast Syria, and 36,000 for northwest Syria. The general security situation throughout Syria remained volatile in August. Intensified hostilities were reported in northwest Syria, with shelling largely concentrated in southern Idleb, northern Latakia and Aleppo, and western Hama. As of July 2021, 1.7 million internally displaced people (IDP) were reported in IDP sites across northwest Syria, with 80 percent of these IDPs being women and children. Furthermore, in Dar\u2019a governorate in southern Syria, the security situation was tense with artillery shelling and ground clashes reported during most of August, in particular in the town of Dar\u2019a Al Balad, resulting in civilian casualties and displacement of more than 38,600 people as of 17 August. The displaced people included around 15,000 women, over 3,200 men and elder- ly, and over 20,400 children. Most IDPs were hosted by relatives in Dar\u2019a city, however, around 1,500 IDPs were accommodated in seven collective shelters. Moreover, Saraya crossing point, a hu- manitarian corridor between Dar\u2019a Al Balad and Dar\u2019a city, has been closed since 12 August, while between 21 and 22 August, it was temporarily opened to allow women, children and the elderly to exit. As a result, access to services and goods across Dar\u2019a Al Balad was extremely challenging in August, with critical shortages of electricity, fuel and bread, as well as the inability to deliver wheat flour to Tishreen and Al Balad bakeries. In response, Dar\u2019a authorities have reallocated this wheat flour to existing bakeries in Dar\u2019a city, Bosra Esh Sham, Tiba, and Da'el to help meet the needs of IDPs. On 30 August, Al Shifa hospital and the National hospital of Dar\u2019a were reportedly attacked by mortars, resulting in structural damage. On 31 August, the Government of Syria and the Dar\u2019a Central Committee held a meeting and agreed to a complete ceasefire to take effect from September 2021 in Dar\u2019a Al-Balad. On 7 August, Damascus governorate issued a decision to stipulate specific opening and closing times for all commercial markets, shops, restaurants, and various economic activities in the gover- norate, aiming to save energy to be redirected to residential users. On 16 August, the Syrian Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade issued a six-month ban on the import of specific commodities as part of a trade rationalization scheme to protect available foreign exchange reserves. This initiative could reduce import expenditures, and therefore save foreign reserves for essential imports, especially wheat flour. On 23 August, a leak from a fuel tank at the Baniyas power plant in Tartous discharged as much as 12,000 cubic meters of oil into the Mediterranean Sea. The World Wildlife Fund organization was deeply concerned about this incident, which could have immediate and long-term effects on coastal ecosystems and vulnerable communities in the area. In August 2021, WFP delivered general food assistance to approximately 4.7 million people across Syria in order to meet the immense humanitarian needs nationwide. Moreover, WFP dispatched 1,500 ready-to-eat rations to IDPs in Dar\u2019a city, and an additional 5,160 rations for about 25,800 IDPs are planned to be distributed to address the dire humanitarian situation in Dar'a.",

    "text": "63555\n\n4.9 million people assisted July 2021 (based on dispatches)\n\nWFP Syria Interim Country Strategic Plan (ICSP)\n\nContact info: Lauren LePage (lauren.lepage@wfp.org) Country Director: Sean O\u2019Brien Further information: www1.wfp.org/countries/syrian-arab-republic\n\nSituation Update\n\nEconomic situation \u2022 In June 2021, the informal exchange rate weakened month-on-month, and the Syrian pound lost one percent of its value, reaching SYP 3,156/USD. The Syrian pound has depreciated by 21 percent since last year. The official exchange rate and the UN operational rate remains at SYP 2,500/USD.\n\nAs of 11 July, the Government of Syria doubled the price of a bundle of bread, from SYP 100/bundle to SYP 200/bundle. The Government also increased the price of subsidized diesel to SYP 500 per litre, an increase of 167 percent (up from SYP 187/litre).\n\nThe nationwide average price of the WFP standard reference food basket1 has decreased for a third consecutive month, reaching SYP 165,932 (USD 66 at the official exchange rate of SYP 2,500/USD) according to the latest WFP Syria Market Price Watch Bulletin.\n\nDespite the slight decrease, food prices in June remained 49 percent higher than six months earlier (December 2020) and 102 percent higher than one year ago (June 2020).\n\nThe standard food basket is a group of essential food commodities. In Syria, the food basket is set at a group of dry goods providing 2,060 kcal a day for a family of five for a month. The basket includes 37 kg bread, 19 kg rice, 19 kg lentils, 5 kg of sugar, and 7 litres of vegetable oil.\n\nFood Security Situation\n\nFood insecurity persisted across the country according to the latest WFP data. The continued deterioration of food security is largely induced by a decade of conflict\n\nand the ongoing economic deterioriation compounded\n\nby the growing financial crisis in Lebanon.\n\nIn July 2021, close to half of households surveyed reported inadequate food consumption, with the highest levels recorded among female-headed households (53 percent). The national average rate of inadequate food consumption increased by three percentage points from June 2021 and up by 15 percent compared to July 2020.\n\nSouthern Syria\n\nThe security situation in Dar\u2019a governorate continued to deteriorate. The recent increase in hostilities led to large displacements from Dar\u2019a al Balad to Dar\u2019a city towards the end of July. Most of the displaced people were hosted by family members, while a smaller number were accommodated in collective shelters.\n\nWFP conducted a rapid assessment on 28 July and found that shelter, food, and health care assistance are the three priority needs among the displaced. In response, WFP triggered its emergency response through the dispatch of ready-to-eat rations (RTEs) on 31 July for those displaced by the on-going fighting. Distributions began in August.\n\nNorth-Western Syria\n\nThe UN Security Council passed Resolution 2585 (2021) on 09 July, authorizing the continued cross-border delivery of humanitarian assistance across the border from Turkey to Syria, through the Bab al-Hawa crossing, for six months. A subsequent renewal for another six months is subject to the issuance of a substantive report by the Secretary-General on transparency in aid delivery operations and progress on crossline access. The security situation in north-western Syria continued to deteriorate over the month of July. No impact on WFP operations was reported. The UNHCR-led Camp Management and Camp Coordination (CCCM) Cluster recorded more than 32,000 displacement movements from Ehsem and Idlib (Idlib governorate), as well as Afrin (Aleppo governorate) towards safer areas over the month of July. This represents a 27 percent decrease compared to June (44,000 displacements). As of July 2021, the CCCM cluster reported 1.7 million IDPs in IDP sites in north- western Syria. Of these, 80 percent are women and children, and 36,825 IDPs are reported to be persons with specific needs.\n\nNorth-Eastern Syria\n\nThe main water pump station in Alouk town in the north- eastern countryside of Al-Hasakeh is partially operational again after having been suspended for more",

    "text": "53681\n\nOPERATIONAL UPDATE\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo February 2021\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, UNHCR DRC is producing a condensed monthly Operational Update. Specific information about UNHCR\u2019s response to COVID-19 in DRC can be found here.\n\nUNHCR continued the voluntary repatriation of both Rwandan and Burundian refugees. 456 Burundian refugees were repatriated from South Kivu Province and 156 Rwandan refugees were repatriated from North Kivu and South Kivu Provinces. UNHCR is physically verifying all 45,007 Burundian refugees residing in South Kivu Province to improve the accuracy of data on refugees, and is providing all refugees with new refugee cards, to ensure better protection and freedom of movement\n\nOver 40,000 Central African asylum seekers have been registered by 28 February 2021 in North Ubangi, South Ubangi and Bas Uele Provinces by UNHCR and the National Commission for Refugees (CNR), while the local authorities had previously estimated that in total around 92,000 individuals could have fled from CAR. The registration of CAR asylum seekers is ongoing in South Ubangi Province and it will soon be implemented in the Bosobolo Territory, North Ubangi, whilst the process is already concluded in the Territory of Ndu, Bas Uele Province and Yakoma Territory, North Ubangi Province.\n\nProtection concerns remain high in the North East of the country. During the reporting period, 96 protection incidents, twice as many as January, were documented, the majority of which were committed in Aru Territory, Ituri Province, and Faradje in Haut-Uele Province and were perpetrated by several non-state armed groups and militias active in the region. Over 60% of the targeted victims are reported to be refugees and over 10% among them asylum seekers. These incidents include predominantly violations of the right to life and physical integrity, sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), violations of the right to property and of\n\nOPERATIONAL UPDATE > DR Congo / February 2021\n\nthe right to liberty. While psychological support and medical care have been provided to all SGBV survivors, access to justice remains challenging in some areas, such as Faradje Territory.\n\nIn Haut Katanga Province, UNCHR and its partner ADSSE have documented 28 refugees with specific needs, of which 15 have already been taken to health centers to receive adequate medical care and regular follow-up\n\nUNHCR and partners continue to promote access to life-saving and essential healthcare to the refugee population. This includes distribution of mosquito nets and malaria treatment, which remains the most common illness among the refugees, as well as support to HIV prevention, through testing and the distribution of contraception among refugees and host population.\n\nWATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE (WASH)\n\nIn Lusenda Camp and Mulongwe Settlement, South Kivu Province, UNHCR together with is partner ADES have continued to improve access to clean water through the construction of five new boreholes and 24 hand washing stations.\n\nUNHCR and NGO partner ADSSE distributed WASH kits composed of jerry cans, buckets and soap to over 18,700 Central African refugees, and 500 host community members in Ndu, Bas Uele Province and Yakoma, North Ubangi Province. Both refugees and local populations are included in the distribution plan, with the aim to reinforce peaceful coexistence.\n\nSHELTER AND CORE RELIEF ITEMS (CRIs)\n\nOver 90 households of 206 people newly relocated in the Bele site, Haut-Uele Province, benefited from the distribution of emergency supplies such as mats, blankets, jerry cans, kitchen sets, buckets and soaps. 78 out of the 90 households received transitional shelters built together with the support of UNHCR and its partners, whilst 11 households joined family members already residing in the Bele site.\n\nUNHCR and the National Commission for Refugees (CNR) continue to advocate with the government for the provision of land to refugees for farming and shelter construction in Bele site, as the number of resettled refugees continue to increase.",

Kindly note: the next Situation Report will be released on 17 May and, thereafter, Situation Reports will be released on a weekly basis, with an expanded scope to capture the impact of the Tripoli clashes on the humanitarian situation throughout Libya.\n\n\uf0b7 The international humanitarian community strongly condemns the apparent direct attack on a clearly marked ambulance on 8 May, injuring two paramedics and leaving the Director of Tripoli\u2019s Ambulance and Emergency Medical Services in critical condition \u2013 the latest in an alarmingly high incidence of attacks on first responders and medical staff.\n\n\uf0b7 An airstrike on the night of 7-8 May injures two persons inside the Tajoura detention centre; UNHCR reiterates calls for the immediate evacuation of refugees and migrants detained in conflict areas.\n\n\uf0b7 The humanitarian impact of Tripoli clashes is felt in the south of Libya, as supplies of essential goods such as food and fuel are disrupted, exacerbating already existing scarcities.\n\npeople internally displaced by ongoing hostilities\n\ncivilian casualties confirmed, including 23 civilian fatalities\n\npeople assisted with some form of humanitarian assistance since the onset of crisis\n\nfunding required for Tripoli Flash Appeal\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nCountry Emergency Situation Report No. 23 | 2\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\n\uf0b7 Attacks on health services: On 8 May, a clearly marked armored ambulance vehicle carrying the Director of Tripoli\u2019s Ambulance and Emergency Medical Services was hit in an apparent direct attack in the Twaisha area of Qasr Bin Ghasheer, injuring two paramedics and leaving the Director in critical condition. He lost both legs in the attack. This is the latest in an alarmingly high incidence of attacks on first responders and medical staff. Since the beginning of the offensive in Tripoli, 4 health workers have been killed, 4 have been injured, 12 ambulances have been impacted and 2 health facilities were evacuated as a result of armed clashes, shelling and airstrikes. These incidents further hamper the ability of already overstretched health services to provide vital assistance to civilians, including those inured as a result of armed conflict. On 9 May, the Humanitarian Coordinator condemned the incident as a serious breach of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The WHO likewise condemned the incident in a statement on 9 May. All parties to the conflict are obligated to take constant care to spare civilians and civilian objects, including medical personnel and assets. Deliberate attacks on clearly marked medical transports constitute war crimes under IHL.\n\n\uf0b7 Civilian casualties: In addition to the health workers injured in the incident on 8 May, Health Sector partners have also verified four civilian casualties resulting from armed clashes and airstrikes on 6-7 May. To date, 111 civilian casualties have been verified by the Health Sector, including 23 civilian deaths1.\n\n\uf0b7 Displacement: According to the latest IOM-DTM figures, approximately 62,700 persons have now fled their homes as a result of the armed conflict. Some 3,900 new IDPs have been identified since 7 May in Qasr Al Akhyar, Tajoura, Suq Al Jumaa, Wershafana, Al Ajayalat, Garabolli and Tripoli. The majority of IDPs are staying in private accommodation, with friends and relatives or in rental accommodation, mainly in urban areas of Tripoli. Many IDPs have also moved to areas along the coastal line of Western Libya and the Nafusa mountains, while approximately 2,700 IDPs are hosted in collective shelters established by local authorities and first responders. 29 collective shelters have been set up to date, the majority of which are in schools with some others in hotels, resorts and university dorms. An increasing number of IDPs are being identified in areas further away from Tripoli, a trend which is likely to increase the radius in need of humanitarian assistance.",

Weeks of torrential downpours have caused deaths, displacement, and massive destructions to key infrastructure and livelihoods across the country.\n\nOver 100 people have lost their lives and the number of people critically affected has exceeded 730,000 as of 16 September, according to the Government\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Commission.\n\nMore than 146,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed, forcing thousands of people to seek refuge with relatives or at public buildings, including schools.\n\nHumanitarian actors have scaled-up operations, in support of the Government-led response. At least 320,000 people have been reached with critical assistance, including shelter, clean water and health services.\n\nHowever, thousands of people are still in need of vital assistance and more funding is urgently required. The overall Humanitarian Response Plan for Sudan is only 44 per cent funded.\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nWeeks of torrential rains and the unprecedented rise of the Nile River have caused one of the worst flooding Sudan has faced in more than three decades. Over 100 people have lost their lives and the number of people critically affected has exceeded 730,000 on 16 September, according to the Government\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC). Sudan had not faced such levels of destruction due to rains since 1988, when nearly 1 million families saw their houses being damaged or completely destroyed by the storms. Exactly two weeks ago, on 4 September, the Transitional Government of Sudan declared a national State of Emergency to increase the efforts to support people in urgent need of assistance.\n\nWith all country\u2019s 18 states affected, Khartoum, North Darfur, West Darfur and Sennar states have been particularly hit. Over 146,000 homes have been destroyed (more than 71,000) or damaged (around 75,000) across the country, leaving thousands of people homeless and forcing them to seek refugee with relatives or at public buildings, including schools. The start of the school year, expected for the end of September, has been postponed until the end of November. Hundreds of schools have been damaged or destroyed and dozens are being used as emergency shelter for people displaced, adding to the already fragile infrastructure that impacts the education system.\n\nThe full impact of the destruction will only be felt in the months ahead. Thousands of hectares of crops have been damaged in the middle of the agricultural season, compromising the harvest and the food security of thousands of families. More than 360 shops and warehouses have been destroyed and over 11,000 livestock have died or were washed away by floodwater, further hampering access to food and critical income for the most vulnerable in the country. Access to clean water and sanitation facilities, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, has also been affected. More than 12,000 latrines were destroyed and the collapse of the Bout Dam puts in risk access to water for more than 100,000 people in Blue Nile\n\nState alone.\n\nKhartoum is the hardest-hit state, with more than 102,000 people affected, as of 16 September. According to HAC, approximately 12,400 houses collapsed due to floods and storms, and other 8,140 are damaged. The Blue Nile and White Nile burst their banks in the capital, flooding several riverine communities. The water level has slightly receded over the last days, but more rains are expected and could lead to renewed flooding and destruction.\n\nPage 1 of 3\n\nDownloaded: 18 Sep 2020\n\nSudan: Floods Flash Update No 7 Last updated: 18 Sep 2020\n\nIn Red Sea State, more than 2,000 houses have been destroyed and approximately 8,000 damaged, leaving over 50,000 people in a dire situation. The storms led the seasonal rivers, including Kor Baraka and Kor Arab to burst their banks,\n\ndestroying critical bridges and blocking roads, including the highway the connects the country\u2019s capital Khartoum to Port",

But the unprecedented flooding has surpassed the forecast and partners are running out of supplies to continue the response.\n\nThe situation could deteriorate over the coming days, as heavy rains forecast in Ethiopia and several parts of Sudan will likely cause the further increase of water levels in the Blue Nile, leading to more flooding and destruction.\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nHeavy rains and flooding in most of Sudan have left a trail of destruction, including damages to homes, infrastructure, croplands and other livelihoods. Over 500 km2 of land appears to be flooded in Khartoum, Al Gezira and White Nile states alone, according to satellite images. Meanwhile, river levels continue to rise and more than 506,000 people have already been affected in 17 of the country\u2019s 18 states, according to data from the Government\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC). Nearly 100 people died due to floods and landslides, and another 46 people have been injured.\n\nThe situation led the Transitional Government of Sudan to declare, on 4 September, a national State of Emergency for the next three months, a decision that will boost efforts of all institutions that will work together to respond to the most urgent needs of those affected.\n\nThe unprecedented storms and flooding have especially affected Khartoum, North Darfur and Sennar States. The River Nile has also burst its banks in several localities in the River Nile and Nothern states, leading to displacement and increased\n\nhumanitarian needs. Over 100,000 homes have been destroyed or damaged across the country, leaving thousands of people\n\nhomeless and forcing them to seek refuges with relatives or at schools. The situation will likely affect the start of the school year in mid-September.\n\nIn Khartoum, the state with the highest number of people affected, riverine and flash floods have left 100,000 people in need of urgent shelter and household supplies, clean water, sanitation and health services in Sharq El Nile, Jebel Aulya, Karari, Omdurman, Um Badah, Khartoum, and Bahri - Khartoum North localities, according to HAC. The storms have affected\n\nrefugees living the Khartoum \u2018Open Area\u2019 site and, according to UNHCR.

Several neighbourhoods and roads are still flooded and about 90 per cent\n\nof those affected lost all their belongings such as mattresses, blankets, water storage containers and kitchen utensils.\n\nMost families whose house have been destroyed need support with emergency shelter.\n\nIn Jebel Aulya Locality, over 1,500 homes have been destroyed and 570 damaged as the White Nile burst its bank on 27 August, flooding at least five riverine villages. Nearly 46,000 people are affected, most of them sheltering with relatives in the area. The destruction of more than 2,000 latrines in the locality increases the risk of disease outbreaks, at the same time as the two health facilities in the area lack medicines and medical supplies.",

    "text": "51265\n\nJANUARY- DECEMBER 2020\n\nVOLUNTARY REPATRIATION UPDATE\n\n2,147 AFGHAN REFUGEES RETURNED IN 2020\n\nDuring 2020, 2,147 Afghan refugees have returned from Pakistan (1,092), Iran (939), and other countries (116) including India, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and the Russian Federation.\n\nAfter a temporary suspension of voluntary repatriation starting on 04 March due to COVID-19, UNHCR resumed its facilitated voluntary repatriation of Afghan refugees from Iran as of 30 April and from Pakistan and other countries as of 10 August 2020.\n\nIn view of increased transportation costs due to COVID-19, as of 01 July 2020, UNHCR has decided to increase the voluntary repatriation cash grant from USD 200 per person to USD 250 per person (on average USD 100 as a transportation grant and USD 150 as an initial integration grant). The additional funds intend to enable returning refugees to arrange adequate transportation to their destinations in\n\nUNHCR, in consultation with the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan, agreed to continue the facilitated voluntary repatriation of Afghan refugees during the winter season. This will enable Afghan refugees to return during the season, including those who were unable to do so in the previous months due to COVID-19 related restrictions. Voluntary repatriation from Iran and other countries has also continued throughout the year.\n\nUNHCR partner staff providing inforamtion about COVID-19 for returnee women, Kabul Encashment Center, Kabul, September 2020, UNHCR/ F. Sattar\n\nThe 7th meeting of the Quadripartite Meeting, chaired by UNHCR, which was attended by the high-level representatives from the Governments of the Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, was virtually held on 01 October 2020. The meeting aimed to discuss progress, challenges and the way forward in relation to the implementation of SSAR to support voluntary repatriation, sustainable reintegration and assistance to host countries. During the meeting, all the parties reaffirmed their commitment to the principle of voluntary, safe and dignified returns.\n\nUNHCR / 17 January 2021\n\nAFGHANISTAN VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION UPDATE\n\nProcess of return\n\nUNHCR\u2019s Voluntary Repatriation Centres (VRCs) in Iran and Pakistan process refugees willing to return to Afghanistan and issue a Voluntary Repatriation Form (VRF) for each family. Two VRCs are located in\n\nPakistan: one in Azakhel in Peshawar (KPK) and the other in Baleli in Quetta (Baluchistan). Repatriation from Iran is facilitated through all UNHCR Offices, including the VRC in Soleimankhani.\n\nUpon return to Afghanistan, returnees are assisted at four Encashment Centers (ECs) located in Kabul, Jalalabad, and Kandahar for returnees from Pakistan and other countries, and in Herat for those returning\n\nfrom Iran.\n\nAt the ECs, all returnees with a valid VRF receive a grant averaging USD 250 per person (based on their area of origin) to support their immediate humanitarian\n\nneeds and transportation costs.\n\nIn addition to cash grants, a range of inter-agency services are provided for returning refugees, including basic health and malnutrition screening and\n\nvaccination (by the Ministry of Public Health supported by WHO and UNICEF), mine risk awareness (by the Danish Demining Group supported by UNMAS), information on school enrolment (by the Ministry of\n\nEducation supported by UNICEF), and overnight\n\nUNHCR and the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation also conduct returnee monitoring and identify persons\n\nwith specific needs to be referred to specialized service\n\nproviders for assessment and assistance.\n\nMine risk education is important as a protection intervention to raise awareness of the threats\n\nassociated with landmines, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and unexploded ordnances to prevent injury and loss of life, particularly for children and those returning to rural areas.\n\nUNHCR / 17 January 2021\n\nIn addition, UNHCR, in line with the measures recommended by MoPH and WHO, adopted a new SOP in all ECs, which is aimed to prevent the spread",

Vulnerable displacement-affected communities, already at high risk for the rapid spread of Covid- 19, are struggling to cope.\n\nIn Afghanistan, where decades of war have left a fragile health system, developing economy and vulnerable population, the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic in Afghanistan threaten to push it to the brink. Amidst a fragile peace process and escalating conflict, Covid-19 has created new risks and humanitarian needs across the country and severely exacerbated existing vulnerabilities - most notably for internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees and host communities.\n\nAlmost the entire population of Afghanistan needs a social safety net with an estimated 14 million people in acute humanitarian need. The economic impacts of Covid-19 in Afghanistan, resulting from a national lockdown and other accompanying public health measures, severely disrupted trade and commerce and limited access for the most vulnerable to humanitarian assistance and services. The knock-on effect of the global economic crash has compounded these impacts and now threatens the very future of an already fragile economy.\n\nFor displacement-affected communities, already at high risk for the rapid spread of Covid-19, the shocks of the pandemic more than six months into the crisis have left families and communities\n\nstruggling to cope. The loss of livelihoods and a dire food security and nutrition situation has left people to use up their savings and take on debt, cut meals and medical expenses, and risk being evicted from their homes. The pandemic and subsequent loss of families\u2019 livelihoods has further\n\ndisrupted children\u2019s access to education, already limited amidst an ongoing conflict. While the world struggles to cope, the long-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic will continue to ripple through Afghanistan and will require concerted and coordinated support from the international\n\n5 respondents in Afghanistan said members of their household had cut the number of meals they eat each day.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has compounded the already dire food security and nutrition situation and, although prices for basic food commodities have shown signs of stabilizing in recent months, prices continue to be higher than pre-crisis levels - with some goods now nearly 30 per cent more\n\nexpensive.5 This has left the poorest households across Afghanistan now largely dependent on cheaper, nutrient-poor staple goods to meet their daily food needs.\n\nEver-present danger, mounting\n\nLost livelihoods, intensifying hunger\n\nIDPs have told NRC staff that they are more concerned about the lack of livelihood opportunities and lack of food than Covid-19. In Afghanistan, over 80 per cent of the population live\n\non less than the internationally applied poverty line (US$1.90 per day)1 and the vulnerability of IDPs, returnees, and host communities has been exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic. Lockdown measures earlier in the crisis significantly decreased daily labour opportunities, reducing\n\nhousehold purchasing power and access to food \u2013 in a recent survey conducted by NRC, 78 per cent of respondents reported that they had lost a job as a result of the crisis.2 In turn, further displacement can be expected as people move to find work.3\n\nAmidst the Covid-19 pandemic, escalating conflict and natural disasters in Afghanistan present ongoing challenges and risks for Afghans. In addition to the 4.1 million people displaced since 2012 who remain in some form of protracted displacement, more than 155,000 people have\n\nbeen displaced by conflict since the onset of the pandemic in mid-March.6 More than six months into the Covid-19 crisis, people across Afghanistan are struggling to cope having used up savings and taking on new debt, but now face additional fears such as being evicted from their homes or having\n\nto resort to negative coping strategies.\n\nAmongst some of the most vulnerable displaced populations, over 80 per cent of families have reported debts7 leading to difficulties in paying rent or other basic housing.

Please note that confirmed COVID-19 cases and number of fatalities are cumulative. All numbers are indicative only, as reported to SMSD Sector following rapid assessments carried out on the day of the incident. The numbers are not verified. Households and/or individuals directly affected by a specific incident, including people injured, relocated, displaced and with damaged shelters. These estimates do not include people who are indirectly affected, e.g. by not being able to access affected facilities. SMSD Sector cannot confirm that drownings resulted from the monsoon, however, the data captures all incidents (windstorm, slope failure, lightning, flood and drowning) reported in the camps during the monsoon season.\n\nISCG COVID-19 and Monsoon Weekly Update #31, 2 to 8 October 2020 | 2\n\nRoutine immunisation sessions continued in the camps with coverage data showing an increasing trend in persons being vaccinated, though Health Sector partners faced challenges tracking unvaccinated and under vaccinated children in the context of COVID-19. During the week, COVID-19 testing of refugees decreased: 652 refugees were tested, compared to 1,172 in the previous week. In host communities, testing also decreased with 353 tests conducted, compared to 382 in the previous week. A total of 25 COVID-19 sample collection sites for suspected COVID-19 cases are operational in the camps, and efforts are ongoing to establish collection sites in all 34 camps. WHO completed training sessions on Community-Based Surveillance, focusing on mortality and reporting for 150 medical doctors, reporting officers and community health worker supervisors.\n\nWATER, SANITATION and HYGIENE (WASH)\n\nWASH Sector partners reached 249,957 individuals through a neighbourhood-based approach and 135,205 individuals through mass media with COVID-19 awareness messages in host and Rohingya communities. In the camps, WASH Sector partners provided soap to 21,623 households and family hygiene kits to 3,819 households, and installed a total of 4,447 handwashing stations (HWS), including 451 HWS in public spaces, 3,992 HWS at household level, and 4 HWS near toilet facilities. As part of COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) compliance in the host communities and camps, WASH Sector partners disinfected 64,981 WASH facilities and 5,426 public buildings.\n\nCOMMUNICATION with COMMUNITIES (CwC WG)\n\nCwC WG partners organised 14 cascade training sessions on COVID-19 with 140 staff and volunteers. CwC WG partners reached 224,535 people in the camps and host communities with key COVID-19 messages through community engagement activities, including 46,790 neighbourhood-based sessions; 12,673 community consultation meetings; 807 listening group sessions; 632 video/film viewings; and 10,385 sessions led by religious leaders. CwC WG partners organised COVID-19 awareness announcements via loudspeakers/megaphones in 19 camps. For receiving community feedback and complaints, 100 information service centres in the camps and 4 information service centres in the host communities were operational. 5 new audio messages and 4 videos on COVID-19 were developed by CwC WG partners.",

Iota originated as a tropical wave that moved into the Eastern Caribbean on 10 November. The storm quickly strengthened into a hurricane on 15 November, becoming a Category 5 hurricane on 16 November. Iota made landfall in Nicaragua and the Gracias a Dios region iin Honduras as a category 5 hurricane on 17 November. Iota then rapidly weakened as it moved inland and dissipated on 18 November.\n\nIota dissipated quickly with winds near 40 mph, according to an advisory from the US National Hurricane Center. Though the wind speeds are dying down, Central America is still at risk for life-threatening flash flooding, river flooding, and mudslides due to the amount of rain caused by both hurricanes. Already parts of the region are coping with overloaded rivers bursting to flip roofs onto streets and down electrical poles. Even before Iota struck, about 3.6 million people across Central America had been affected by Eta, a storm that hovered for days over Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala, with heavy rains creating flooding and landslides.1\n\nNational Societies are responding to the emergency and providing much-needed support and assistance. Volunteers and staff have been deployed to remote locations following safety protocols to protect communities and resources. Activities are being supported by the Americas Regional Office and working together with Red Cross Movement partners, authorities, community organizations, and other organizations. Iota's actual impact will be clearer within a couple of days when humanitarian responders and assessment teams can arrive in the affected areas. Damages assessments have been delayed due to access and lack of stability in communications. Thanks to Airbus Air Foundation, the Red Cross teams are conducting air assessments and distributing initial humanitarian aid.\n\nstated that Iota is the most potent hurricane that has made landfall in Nicaragua since it records tropical cyclones. It is estimated that Iota affected about 60% of Nicaragua's territory, initially impacting Puerto Cabezas and Bilwi (Northern Caribbean) and affecting the South Pacific homes lost, local markets and crops destroyed, and extensive damage have no access to drinking water, an area where 30% of the population and damage to infrastructure and housing could be extensive. Logistical and communication difficulties are reported for the delivery of supplies due to the destruction of Puerto Cabezas and the lack of land",

    "text": "26133\n\nBorno and Yobe States Monthly Market Monitoring Report February 2020 - ISSUE 33 1\n\nFigure 1 Market price monitoring locations in Borno and Yobe States\n\nFood basket monitoring\n\nThe Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB) outlines the minimum food items needed for survival of a household in a month. The basket comprises basic energy food requirements of 2,100 kilocalories per person per day and include food items like rice, maize, red beans, palm oil,\n\nvegetable oil, salt and sugar, consumed by the majority of households in the North East.\n\nBetween January and February 2020, the cost of the Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB) for a family of five increased by five (5) percent from 16,011.03 Naira to 16,857.44 Naira in Maiduguri and Jere. Similarly, in Damaturu, during the same period the SMEB increased by two (2) percent between January and February (from 11,403.00 Naira to 11,658.15 Naira). The\n\nSMEB consists of key staples (rice, maize, beans and peanuts) which account for 85 percent of the food basket. Important to point out that the SMEB tables below applies to Maiduguri and Damaturu only. The slight increase in the SMEB, due to the price increase in imported rice, it\n\nis unlikely that households\u2019 access to food would be less as households would likely substitute the imported rice component with another affordable staple food to ensure that their basic food needs are met.\n\nBorno and Yobe States Monthly Market Monitoring Report February 2020 - ISSUE 33 2\n\nFood items price trends in Borno and Yobe markets\n\nThe prices of key staples (Maize, Sorghum, red beans and peanuts) continue to either remain stable or decrease, except the retail price of imported rice in Borno and Yobe states which either increased or stabilized. To cope with price increase for imported rice households are switching from imported to local rice. Consequently the price of local rice is either increasing by 9 to 41\n\nThe price of onion has exhibited an unprecedented increase of 50 to 100 percent in some mar- kets in Yobe state, while in Borno, retail price was stable across monitored markets. The retail price of cooking oil (palm and vegetable oil) has increased by a range of 11 to 30 percent in all monitored markets in Borno and Yobe State as compared the past three months except for Damaturu and Geidam markets where the prices have remained stable.\n\nFigure 4: Depicts the nominal price of some key staples: maize flour, red beans, import- 400 ed rice and ground nuts in monitored mar- kets of Borno state. Compared to the same period in 2018 and its 2 year average, the prices of red beans and maize flour de- creased by 40 and 21 percent. While the prices of imported rice showed an increase of 7 percent.\n\nBorno and Yobe States Monthly Market Monitoring Report February 2020 - ISSUE 33 3\n\nBorno and Yobe States Monthly Market Monitoring Report February 2020 - ISSUE 33 4\n\n",

As of June 2018, more than one million individuals have returned home across 22 governorates.\n\nThe military offensive in Al-Hudaydah continues with more than 78,400 families displaced since the onset of the clashes. Since 1 October, some 8,100 newly displaced households from Al-Hudaydah reached the southern governorates, leading to a total of 24,366 households that have been displaced to Taizz Governorate and Al Hudaydah coast line districts (Hays, Al- Khawkha and Mawza). UNHCR is advocating for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and for all parties to adhere to their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. So far, UNHCR has assisted more than 100,000 people as part of the Al-Hudaydah response.\n\nOn 6 October, one woman was killed and 12 civilians were injured, including eight children, in a shelling incident that occurred at the Bani Jaber internally displaced person (IDP) camp in the Al-Khawkhah district in Al-Hudaydah Governorate. As many as 17 civilians have reportedly been killed or seriously injured in October. Since 2016, over 65,000 Yemenis are estimated to have either been killed or injured as a result of the conflict; this includes 16,000 civilian deaths that have been documented by the United\n\nIDP Response\n\nUNHCR activities are ongoing in Hajjah and Al-Hudaydah Governorates despite the continued deterioration of the security situation. Following the attack in the IDP camp in the Al-Khawkhah district of Al-Hudaydah Governorate, UNHCR\u2019s partner Danish Refugee Council is providing psychosocial support and emergency cash assistance to 80 affected families.\n\nUNHCR provided assistance through its partners in the form of non-food items (NFI), emergency shelter kits (ESK) and protection monitoring in areas that remain accessible in Al-Hudaydah. On 1 October 2018, UNHCR and its partner Jeel Albena completed the distribution of 2,973 NFIs and 1,067 ESKs in the As-Sukhna district of Al-Hudaydah. The distribution targeted 2,973 families who fled the armed clashes in Kilometre 16 and Kilometre 10 in Al- Hudaydah city.\n\nAs of 4 October, the overall Shelter/CRI cluster response in Al-Hudaydah Governorate has reached a total of 25,743 households with NFIs and ESKs. In detail, the Al-Hudaydah Hub assisted 16,807 households; the Aden Hub assisted 2,978 households; the Ibb/Taizz Hub assisted 2,584 households; and the Sana\u2019a Hub assisted 3,374 households (Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster).\n\nDuring the reporting period, the IDP Community Centre run by UNHCR\u2019s partner, the Hudaydah Girls Foundation (HGF), undertook a protection assessment for 1,722 households in various districts of Al-Hudaydah, while the IDP Community Centre run by UNHCR\u2019s partner ADRA in Hajjah, conducted protection assessments for 198 households (110 IDP and 88 host community households) in Abs district.\n\nOn 25 and 26 September, UNHCR conducted a remote verification for lists of multi-purpose cash assistance beneficiaries covering 3,423 families in\n\nYEMEN UPDATE 1 \u2013 21 September 2018\n\nHajjah Governorate and 496 families in Al-Hudaydah Governorate. UNHCR\u2019s multi-purpose cash distributions enable persons of concern to meet their families\u2019 most basic needs during this time of crisis. Without adequate financial support, they are likely to be exposed to increased protection risks and resort to negative coping mechanisms. In 2018, UNHCR and its partners assisted over 66,400 families across the country (62,026 families in the north and 4,600 families in the south) with multi-purpose cash grants and cash for rental subsidies.",

Until recently, she lived with her family in a single room shelter that had no permanent roof or walls to protect against heavy rain during monsoon storms. Excessive rainfall would often cause landslides and flooding around her house. Through support from a Shelter/NFI Sector partner, Sammiyao bought new bamboo, cement and corrugated tin to reinforce her shelter and has rebuilt it on an elevated platform to avoid flooding. Read more\n\nKey COVID-19 figures this week1\n\nMonsoon-related Incidents2 reported this week\n\nHost community/Cox\u2019s Bazar District information is from WHO daily update. 2 All numbers are indicative only, as reported to SMSD Sector following rapid assessments carried out on the day of the incident. The numbers are not verified.\n\nISCG COVID-19 and Monsoon Weekly Update #19, 10 to 16 July 2020 | 2\n\nAs of 16 July, 1,894 patients with symptoms of mild respiratory tract infections and 14 patients with moderate/severe COVID-like symptoms had been identified and referred to health facilities in the camps. A significant increase in the number of COVID-19 samples collected in the refugee camps was reported during the week (some 357 tests recorded compared to 43 tests recorded in the last week of June). The increase is due to comprehensive efforts led by the Health Sector, with close support from CWC WG and other Sectors to increase awareness and understanding of COVID-19 testing and treatment options. In addition, enhanced community-based surveillance is operational and Community Health Workers (CHWs) continue to identify and refer suspected COVID-19 cases to health facilities. A significant decrease in the number of samples collected from the host community has been observed since the introduction of fees for testing in government health facilities (379 during the reporting period, compared to 1,030 in the last week of June).\n\nWATER, SANITATION and HYGIENE (WASH)\n\nWASH Sector partners reached 259,295 individuals through a neighbourhood- based approach and 240,445 individuals through mass outreach with COVID-19 awareness messages in host and Rohingya communities. In the camps, WASH Sector partners provided soap to 32,703 households and family hygiene kits to 20,298 households, and installed 3,797 hand-washing stations (HWS), 75 HWS with bucket-drums at household level, 19 HWS at public places, 2,227 tippy taps (a cost-effective hands-free device for handwashing) and 1,495 stools (with a bucket and tap) at household-level. As part of COVID-19 risk prevention measures and infection prevention and control (IPC) compliance in host communities and camps, partners disinfected 54,809 WASH facilities and 2,178 public buildings.\n\nCOMMUNICATION with COMMUNITIES (CwC WG)\n\nCwC WG partners organised 36 cascade training sessions on COVID-19 with 370 staff and volunteers. CwC WG partners reached 212,693 people in the camps and host community with key COVID-19 messages through community engagement activities, including 49,421 neighbourhood-based sessions, 16 sessions on home-based health care for older persons, 14,593 community consultation meetings, 1,491 radio group listening sessions, 389 video/film viewings, and an additional 4,070 sessions led by religious leaders. For community feedback and complaints, 80 information service centres in the camps and 3 information service centres in the host community were operational. CwC WG published its 14th COVID-19 Risk Communication and Community Engagement Update, which includes the latest 3 audio recordings, 2 printable resources and 2 video programs on COVID-19 developed by\n\nFOOD SECURITY (FSS)\n\n400 FSS volunteers to assist with Communication with Communities have now been deployed across 17 e-voucher outlets in the camps. Volunteers are holding focus group discussions with Rohingya beneficiaries in order to understand their concerns and priorities to ensure community-driven decision-making regarding food baskets and food assistance. Under the Livelihoods Working Group (LHWG), As of 16 July, approximately 208,000 individuals in the camps and 123,000 individuals in the host community were reached with a total of 662,00 reusable cloth masks (two masks per person).",

    "text": "53038\n\n********* [PAGE 1 START] *********\n\nThis report is produced by OCHA Cameroon in collaboration with the COVID-19 Task Force. It covers the period from 1 to 31 December 2020. The next report will be issued in February 2021.\n\nIn Cameroon like in most countries, COVID-19 crisis has negatively impacted the general situation. As of 31 December, WHO reported 26,277 cumulative cases and 448 deaths in the country with a fatality rate of 1.7 per cent.\n\nIn his end year address to the Nation on 21 December 2020, the Head of State reminded of the necessity to abide by measures to stop the spread of COVID- 19. He noted that despite efforts made, COVID-19 has caused grief to many families and negatively affected the economy and the Cameroonian society. Additionally, the Minister of Health (MoH) called for the respect of distancing measures, especially with the end year celebrations and the prominence of a more contagious strain of the virus in Europe.\n\nAccording to the results of the Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP)\u2019 survey which UNICEF and WHO carried out in October 2020, the lowest level of knowledge on COVID-19 is observed in the West region and negative attitudes and practices are more common in the Centre and Far North\n\nWHO has mobilized US$ 3.9 million for the fight against COVID-19 in the North-West and South-West regions which are severely affected by the crisis.\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nCameroon is facing a significant upsurge in COVID-19 cases. According to WHO, more than 5,000 new cases have been recorded between November and December 2020.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nCameroon: COVID-19 Emergency Situation Report No. 12 | 2\n\nOn 31 December 2020, Cameroon had more than 26,000 positive cases. It is the eleventh African country in relation to the number of infections. Nevertheless, Cameroon has the highest recovery rate of 95 per cent.\n\nOn 28 and 29 December, the Minister of Health (MoH) intensified consultations with different COVID-19 response stakeholders in Cameroon, to assess the response and identify prospects especially considering a possible second wave of\n\nThe Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) survey indicated that 72 per cent of the people have an acceptable knowledge on COVID-19. While 30 per cent of surveyed individuals developed adequate attitudes, 74 per cent adopt adequate practices. The lowest level of knowledge on COVID-19 is observed in the West region where negative attitudes and practices are more common respectively in the Centre and Far North regions. It is worth noting that surveys carried out before had shown that 80 per cent of surveyed individuals had acceptable knowledge on COVID-19. The recent KAP survey covered a wider population though.\n\nGaps & constraints\n\nThe consultations carried out by the MoH allowed to identify gaps in the implementation of the response strategy, notably: \u2022 Inconsistencies in data collected from health districts make the analysis challenging, raising the need for an exchange platform between data managers at the central level and those at the peripheral level, such as health districts and health regional delegations, in order to improve the quality of data as part of the management of epidemics and other public health emergencies. \u2022 The lack of standardized procedures, data collection tools, contact tracking tools, and especially the limited capacity of key stakeholders to use these tools. These capacities and tools are essential for the preparation of responses to public health emergencies.\n\nINTER-AGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nAll humanitarian partners, including donors and recipient agencies, are encouraged to inform OCHA's Financial Tracking Service (FTS - http://fts.unocha.org) of cash and in-kind contributions by e-mailing: fts@un.org",

    "text": "5084\n\n27 July \u2013 3 August\n\nUNHCR FLASH UPDATE\n\nPopulation Movements\n\nSo far in 2018, the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG) rescued/intercepted some 12,152 refugees and migrants at sea during 88 operations. Since June, the number of operations increased when compared to the previous months, with over 5,000 refugees and migrants brought back to Libya (1,756 individuals in May, 3,453 individuals in June and 2,231 individuals in July). During the reporting period, more than 800 refugees and migrants disembarked in the Azzawya Port (36 individuals) and the Tripoli Naval Base (785 individuals). UNHCR and its partner International Medical Corps (IMC) provided non-food items (NFIs) and medical assistance both at the disembarkation points and in the detention centres to which individuals were subsequently transferred by the authorities.\n\nUNHCR Response\n\nOn 30 July, UNHCR visited the city of Tawergha (290 km East of Tripoli) for the first time. Tawergha had been deserted since 2011 and currently suffers from a lack of basic services and infrastructure. UNHCR met with families who recently returned to the city after seven years of displacement. Returnees requested the United Nations\u2019 support in ensuring that conditions for a safe return are met. UNHCR met with the Tawergha Local Council and civil society representatives to discuss current needs in the city and prospects for a safe, voluntary and dignified return. UNHCR continues to support IDP and returnee communities by providing humanitarian assistance across Libya. So far in 2018, UNHCR distributed NFIs (including blankets, clothes, solar lamps, heaters, sleeping mats, baby kits and jerry cans) to more than 31,000 IDPs and returnees (8,836 families). UNHCR also provided cash support to 12,686 individuals (2,261 families) and implemented a total of 75 quick-impact projects across Libya benefiting both IDPs and hosting communities.\n\nUNHCR estimates that there are 8,000 individuals currently detained in Libya, of whom more than 4,300 persons are of concern to UNHCR. UNHCR continues to register persons in need of international protection at detention centres in Libya and to advocate for alternatives to detention. UNHCR\u2019s refugee protection mandate necessitates that the Office has access to and be present in detention centres for the purpose of identifying those in need of international protection. At the detention centres, UNHCR and its partners distribute humanitarian assistance, advocate for release from detention and undertake screening, counselling and registration. The assistance that UNHCR provides in detention facilities aims at alleviating the suffering of detainees. As of 1 August, UNHCR distributed 11,713 NFIs to refugees and migrants at detention centres in Libya. UNHCR and its partner IMC also provided 18,500 primary health care consultations and more than 200 medical referrals. As a result of UNHCR\u2019s advocacy, 1,527 asylum-seekers and refugees were released from detention in 2018.\n\nDuring the reporting period, more than 550 refugees and asylum-seekers were provided with assistance at UNHCR\u2019s Community Day Centres (CDCs) in Tripoli. The CDCs provide a safe space for refugees and asylum-seekers to receive support in terms of registration, cash and medical assistance (including primary health-care, medical referrals and psychological and psychiatric assistance). UNHCR and its partners, IMC and CESVI, also conduct outreach visits to refugee families living in Tripoli. These monitoring visits help assess their living conditions to then provide targeted assistance. So far in 2018, UNHCR and its partners provided 6,000 primary health-care consultations and 1,000 medical referrals at the CDCs. Additionally, more than 2,300 individuals received cash assistance. UNHCR and its partners also carried out outreach visits to 230 families (939 individuals).\n\nSpecial thanks to our donors: Australia | Denmark | European Union | Germany | Italy | The Netherlands | Norway | Sweden | Switzerland | United Kingdom",

    "text": "31923\n\nOn 7 May, the second iteration of the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) for COVID-19 was released, containing\n\na dedicated chapter on the revised Refugee and Migration Response Plan (RMRP). It draws on the work of the Regional Platform and its now 151 partners who are part of the regional COVID-19 response for refugees and migrants from Venezuela and affected host communities. The revised RMRP is due to be released on 12 May and will be presented at the meeting of\n\nthe Regional Platform on 14 May 2020.\n\nAmidst rising level of dispair among those who are unable to meet basic needs, host country governments are receiving increasing numbers of requests from refugees and migrants from Venezuela for support to return to their home country. This demonstrates the precariousness of the situation that an ever-growing number of refugees and migrants is facing in host countries and is a cause for great concern among R4V partners given the health and protection risks associated with returns under the current circumstances.\n\nSome countries in the region including Aruba, Curacao, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, are beginning to ease movement restrictions, by reopening certain industries, such as mining and manufacturing, as well as government offices. On the other hand, in view of a continued rise in COVID-19 cases, other countries are extending the restrictions further.\n\nPlatforms\u2019 Response**\n\nIn Colombia, on 3 May, the President announced the collaboration with the governments of Peru and Brazil to strengthen controls in the Amazon border area, in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. On 6 May, the Inter-Agency Group for Mixed Migration Flows (GIFMM) launched the report of a Joint Rapid Needs Assessment developed by 13 partners, analyzing\n\nthe results of 737 telephone surveys in 17 departments on the situation of refugee and migrant households in the context of\n\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the arrival of Venezuelans from Ecuador at the transport terminal of the Colombian border town of Ipiales the local GIFMM in Nari\u00f1o is working with local authorities to provide an adequate response.\n\nIn Brazil, the Area of Protection and Care (APC), created by Opera\u00e7ao Acolhida to isolate and treat COVID-19 cases in Roraima, is currently hosting 80 refugees and migrants from Venezuela. R4V partners are supporting refugees and migrants in the Tancredo Neves shelter in Boa Vista to produce cloth masks for distribution to other sheltered Venezuelans. So far, a first batch of 220 masks was produced. This week, 15 refugee and migrant families in the Nueva Canaan shelter in Boa Vista were supported to apply for the emergency benefit of the Federal Government for the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe Grupo de Trabajo para Refugiados y Migrantes (GTRM) in Ecuador has begun discussions with six local GTRMs in order to strengthen coordination mechanisms. The national GTRM has published information on different services and information available to refugees and migrants during the COVID-19 emergency.\n\nIn Peru, some industries are preparing to resume activities, however it is unclear whether the hiring or re-hiring of refugees and migrants will be permitted in the current context. Partners continue supporting hospitals with refugee housing units\n\nand blankets to increase patient reception capacity. On 7 May, the Superintendence of Migration (SNM) authorized the\n\nissuance of certificates to foreign citizens that had begun procedures to obtain the carn\u00e9 de extranjer\u00eda and the temporary stay permit (PTP) before the COVID-19 emergency. These documents will ease the current mobility restrictions faced by undocumented refugees and migrants.\n\nThe contagion reached its peak last week in Chile. Districts particularly affected by COVID-19 include Quilicura and Recoleta, counting large numbers of refugees and migrants amongst its residents. Final adjustments were made to R4V projects in line with global COVID-19 guidance, and R4V partners are being trained on R4V monitoring and reporting tools.",

The majority were Venezuelans (89 percent), followed by Colombians (9 percent) and a few beneficiaries from other nationalities. 3,131 people, around 77 percent of them from Venezuela, were assisted at shelters and canteens managed by WFP partner organizations. 30,843 vulnerable Venezuelans received one-time food assistance at immigration checkpoints. Since August 26 2019, Venezuelans require a humanitarian visa to enter Ecuador. This measure is directly correlated to an increase in the number of irregular entries. Around 600 vulnerable pregnant adolescents from the northern border provinces received a cash-based transfer to facilitate their access to nutritious and healthy food. Several workshops related to sexual and reproductive health and nutrition were organized in coordination with the Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion, the Ministry of Health and UNFPA. The first Biannual Consultation on Development between USAID and the Government of Ecuador took place in August. USAID's official visit included encounters with Venezuelan families that benefit from food assistance channelled through WFP. The UN Resident Coordinator and a representative from OCHA visited WFP\u2019s operation in Manab\u00ed to get a deeper understanding of the food assistance implementation scheme. In coordination with UN Women, Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) surveys were collected among Aw\u00e1 and Afro Ecuadorian population. This is part of the gender mainstreaming strategy of the Binational Project implemented in coordination with WFP UNICEF, WHO, FAO and WFP subscribed a Letter of Understanding with the Ministry of Education. This reinforces the cooperation for the strengthening of the school feeding public policy.\n\n\u2022 Complement the Government's social protection strategy by providing Cash-Based Transfers to the most vulnerable populations and support in vulnerability analysis and knowledge management. \u2022 Strengthen strategies to link sustainable livelihoods to food security and nutrition activities.\n\n\u2022 Support and increase the participation of smallholder farmer organizations in national and local commercial mechanisms and institutional markets. \u2022 Strengthen the capacity of farmer organizations.\n\n\u2022 Strengthen or develop emergency preparedness, response, and early warning systems. \u2022 Strengthen the implementation of adaptation and resilience\n\n\u2022 Technical assistance, research and assessments, to improve the implementation of programs linked to food security and nutrition. \u2022 Knowledge management, sharing of best practices and studies, including South-South cooperation.\n\nWFP Ecuador Country Brief August 2019\n\nThe country's current economic situation curbs access to adequate employment opportunities for locals and newly arrived migrants. This creates tensions and increases difficulties of integration into local The State of Emergency declared by the Government continues only in Carchi, Pichincha and El Oro. Limiting the emergency status to these provinces does not fully reflect the increasing needs of Venezuelan migrants Increased irregular entries of the Venezuelan population makes coordination at immigration checkpoints a challenge. Ivan Marquez, a former senior commander of the dissolved FARC rebel army in Colombia and Jesus Santrich announced on August 29 that they are taking up arms again, accusing the Colombian Government of betraying the peace agreement. This poses a threat to the peace deals and puts pressure on the security situation in the northern border with Colombia.\n\nRegional encounters to strengthen public policies for rural women",

It is now on 8th place in the world for deaths per million people, and to 4th place in the region, after Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil, compared to its 4th place in August. The country is in general slowly moving out of lockdowns. The focus of the lockdown comunas shifted from Greater Santiago to the southern and northern Chile, where the population density is lower but so is the capacity of the hospitals. Nightly curfews continue nationwide. Schools slowly started to reopen. As of end October, 6% of schools are open or in process of reopening. \u2022 UNICEF continues to assist the development of protocols for reopening schools, in close coordination with UNESCO. The first draft of the protocols for reopening schools is being finalized. UNICEF contributes for the Education sector coordination by facilitating the organization of a coordination mechanism of the education actors of the civil society. UNICEF contributes to the Congess\u2019 discussion on the new migration law and makes efforts to ensure the link between interventions in COVID-19 emergency and development.

Suspected sharp increase of\n\ncases in September following the National Day celebrations did not happen.\n\nAccording to WHO COVID-19 Dashboard on 26 October, Chile is no longer in its 12 countries in the world for highest confirmed cases per million people, compared to its 9th place in September. It is now on 8th place in the world for deaths per million people, after Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil in the region, compared to its 4th place in August.\n\nThe majority of the country is coming out of lockdown. As of 26 October, out of 345 comunas of the country, 27 comunas are in step-1 (lockdown, compared to 43 a month ago), 75 in step-2 (transition, compared to 44), 209 in step-3 (preparation, compared to 204), and 34 in step-4 (initial opening, compared to 49). The focus of the lockdown comunas shifted from Greater Santiago to the southern and northern Chile, where the population density is lower but so is the capacity of the hospitals. In comunas in step-1&2, lockdown of weekends and holidays continues. Nightly curfews continue nationwide.\n\nSchools are slowly reopening in Chile, while there is a conflicting position between MOE and a group of associations. As of 27 October, 219 schools are open and 602 in the process of re-opening (i.e. waiting for the MOE approval)1, representing 6% of all 13,056 schools at all levels in the country2. The number of children attending school is being\n\nconfirmed, as the attendance rate depends on each school.\n\nAs of 23 October, according to MOE, 43% of opened schools are in the Santiago Metropolitan Region, followed by Los Rios region in the south. No schools are open in the four northern regions where the COVID-19 cases are high. Opened schools include previously reported Easter Island and Juan Fernandez archipelago with a total of 1,152\n\nchildren. A rapid increase is observed with the number of schools requesting to open, and around 30 more schools\n\nare expected to open before end of October.\n\nA public school in the rural area of B\u00edo B\u00edo region was put on fire and burned down, affecting 126 children, on 20 October. The motive nor the responsible for this incident is not known. This was the 4th school burned down in the same area in 2020, following 3 schools in July, affecting a total of 154 children.\n\nFunding Overview and Partnerships",

As the situation continues to evolve, the region is still relatively less impacted than the rest of the continent. As of 28 October, there were 189,406 confirmed COVID- 19 cases in the 11 countries overseen by the EHAGL Bureau. For the past week, the EHAGL region reports 11% of the total COVID-19 cases in Africa, as well as a decrease from 20% to 19% of the total tests reported on the continent. Since the first confirmed COVID-19 related death on 21 March, there are now some reported 3,597 deaths in the region, (equivalent to an increase from 8% to 9% in the last week of the death cases on the continent) of which 89% are in three countries \u2013 Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan.\n\nWhile so far there has still been no large-scale outbreak in the approximately 100 refugee camps and settlements in the region, 4.6 million refugees and their host communities are at risk, as are some 8.1 million IDPs. The need for preparedness remains urgent as cases are still rising in all countries of the region and a number of locations still lack adequate quarantine, testing and isolation/treatment facilities. Governments have put in place various measures to contain the spread of the virus and are periodically announcing changes to movement and other restrictions, and gradually lifting preventive measures initially adopted.\n\nCOVID-19 prevention and awareness have now been integrated in most of UNHCR\u2019s activities across the region. Nevertheless, UNHCR remains on heightened alert as recent figures demonstrate that cases across the region are on the increase. Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda especially have seen a recent spike in numbers. In South Sudan, the Doctors Union (SSDU) has warned that the country is most likely to experience a second wave of COVID-19 with more fatal cases if heightened efforts to fight the virus are not implemented. The SSDU has cautioned that many citizens and officials appear to have relaxed safety measures.\n\nKey Measures Taken\n\n*COVID-19 Case information: WHO, John Hopkins University, Ministries of Health, Governments. Note: COVD-19 cases refer to total cases reported in the countries of asylum. IDP figures source: IOM, OCHA and UNHCR.\n\nSupporting national authorities in ensuring that prevention, preparedness and response are ongoing in all locations.\n\nEnsuring basic assistance and minimum standards during quarantine for new asylum seekers and refugees who have travelled internally within host\n\nProcurement and distribution of PPE, health and sanitation equipment and supplies is ongoing.\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nEHAGL REGIONAL EXTERNAL UPDATE #22 > COVID-19\n\nUNHCR Response\n\nUNHCR continues to assess the impact of border closures and travel restrictions on access to asylum. Movements continue through unofficial border crossing points where screening and provision of information is not in place. Across the region, UNHCR has appealed for special measures to be put in place, to allow for asylum-seekers to be screened, quarantined and admitted, and for UNHCR to be granted access to areas where new refugees are arriving. On 30 June, UNHCR launched a global online Platform on the protection impact of temporary measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including access to territory and national asylum systems.\n\nThe reporting period saw the voluntary repatriation of Burundian refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda and Tanzania. Between 15-22 October, a total of 2,706 Burundians returned including 850 from Rwanda and 1,856 from Tanzania. The total number of repatriated refugees from Rwanda stands now at 3,444 individuals, 43% of the 8,000 anticipated in the last quarter of 2020. The majority of the repatriated refugees are from Mahama (3,311) and some few from urban settings (133). The total number from Tanzania stands at 21,702 since the beginning of the year. Additional health screening measures and protocols have been put in place and UNHCR and partners continue to expand the reception capacity at transit centers in Burundi. There is still a need for substantive infrastructure rehabilitation and construction as the current capacity of the transit centers are highly overstretched by the ongoing repatriation convoys increasing the risk of spreading the virus.",

Situation Update\n\nCategory 3 Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall on the evening of 14 March 2019 in Beira, Mozambique\u2019s fourth largest city, bringing high wind speeds of up to 224 km per hour and heavy rains.\n\nInitial reports state 100 people are feared dead in Mozambique and neighbouring Malawi due to the heavy rainfall (OCHA), while 103,169 people have been affected by the floods in the Mozambiquean provinces of Zamb\u00e9zia, Tete and Niassa (RC Office, Mozambique).\n\nAt least 17,095 people are displaced in Zamb\u00e9zia, Tete and Niassa sheltered in 15 transit centres across the three provinces (IFRC). The National Disaster Management Agency (INGC) estimates over 600,000 people will be affected by the cyclone (OCHA).\n\nThe INGC has established an initial coordination centre, Centro Operativo de Emerg\u00eancia (COE), in Caia. In addition, a government humanitarian operations centre is being established in Beira to allow for closer proximity to the affected areas.\n\nGiven the extent of flooding and expected impact of Cyclone Idai, a scale-up of inter-agency coordination for logistics activities may be required to respond to identified gaps and to ensure the delivery of emergency relief items (currently estimated at 4,250 MT or 14,000 m3).\n\nThe Logistics Cluster has not yet been activated; the country\u2019s Logistics Working Group remains in place. An initial logistics coordination meeting was held in the country\u2019s capital city, Maputo, on March 14.\n\nThe Global Logistics Cluster has sent an assessment team of two people. A Coordinator and Information Management Officer, were deployed to Mozambique on 15 March to assess the needs for common logistics services in the north and central part of the country. The team departed by road to Beira on 16 March as part of an inter-agency convoy. The convoy is expected to arrive on 17 March.\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP), as global lead of the Logistics Cluster and the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC), is working on a USD 2.2 million proposal. The proposal is for the provision of common logistics and communications services for identified operational areas across Sofala, Tete and Zamb\u00e9zia provinces (in the central region) and Niassa province (in the country\u2019s north) for a 3- month period. The proposal includes the deployment of one UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) helicopter to facilitate access to affected areas.\n\n2. Logistics Infrastructure\n\nAir operations\n\nMaputo international airport remains fully operational.\n\nOn 13 March, Mozambique national carrier LAM cancelled all commercial flights to Beira and Quelimane on the country\u2019s coastline, as well as to Chomoio, which is located inland from Beira. As of 16 March, all domestic flights to the three locations are still cancelled.\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nSituation Update, 16 March 2019 Mozambique: Tropical Cyclone Idai\n\nThe cyclone caused extensive damage to the airport terminal in Beira. Navigation and weather reporting systems are also not functional. An UNHAS representative is in Beira to conduct preliminary assessments to identify the most suitable location to base air operations for the response. \u2022 To support the efficient delivery of humanitarian aid, one WFP-contracted MI-8 helicopter will arrive in Beira on Monday 18 March. This helicopter will be immediately operational after inspection by Mozambique\u2019s Civil Aviation Authorities. Sea ports Maputo port remains fully operational. \u2022 Beira\u2019s sea port has been seriously affected; extent of the damage is not yet known. Road access An access assessment of the Caia-Sena road (Sofala province) has been conducted. The assessment showed the road had been cut-off for 43 km due to a flood wave that started in Cahora Bassa in Tete province. \u2022 Humanitarian actors reported the road connecting Caia and Beira is only passable with 4x4 vehicles. \u2022 The Chimoio-Beira road is closed to traffic due a collapsed bridge in Niatamand. Due to the flooded road in Nhamatanda, Beira is not reachable by road from Maputo. \u2022 According to WFP, the following roads are still impassable in Zamb\u00e9zia province due to flooding: o R640 Mopeia/Luabo; o NC Morrumbala/ Megaza; o NC Kizombe/Mureremba; o NC Mandiua/Posto Chire; o R652 Derre/Alto Benfica; o R650 Milange/ Molumbo; o R653 Mocuba/ Lugela; o R 644 Maganja/ Nante; o N323/N324 Maganja/Pebane \u2022 The Logistics Cluster is currently working on the production of a Road Access Constraints map. The map will be distributed to partners and published on the Mozambique country page once updated. Electricity from the power grid in Beira is expected to continue to be unreliable until the end of the month.",

    "text": "9136\n\nLassa Fever \u2013 Nigeria\n\nDisease outbreak news 14 February 2019\n\nFrom 1 January through 10 February 2019, 327 cases of Lassa fever (324 confirmed cases and three probable cases) with 72 deaths (case fatality ratio = 22%) have been reported across 20 states and the Federal Capital Territory, with the majority of cases being reported from Edo (108) and Ondo (103) states. Twelve cases have been reported among healthcare workers in seven states \u2013 Edo (4), Ondo (3), Ebonyi (1), Enugu (1), Rivers (1), Bauchi (1) and Benue (1) including one death in Enugu.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases reported across Nigeria remains high. In week 6, 2019 (week ending 10 February 2019), 37 new confirmed cases including 10 deaths (case fatality ratio = 27%) were reported from nine states across Nigeria. The majority of cases were reported from Ondo (12) and Edo (10) states. The number of confirmed cases reported in week 6, 2019 represents a slight decrease compared to week 5 when 68 confirmed cases were reported (Figure\n\nOf the 3746 contacts identified since January 2019, 2658 are still under follow-up while 1045 have completed 21 days of follow-up. Sixty contacts became symptomatic, of which 39 tested\n\nNinety-one case-patients are currently in admission at treatment centers across the country. The case-patients are being treated with standard supportive care.\n\nFigure 1: Number of confirmed and probable Lassa fever cases in Nigeria reported by the week of illness onset from 1 January through 10 February 2019\n\nSource: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)\n\nPublic health response\n\nOn 22 January 2019, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) declared the outbreak an emergency. Multi-sectoral One Health national rapid response teams have been deployed to Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Plateau, and Bauchi to support field investigation and response activities. Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all states following alert communication and a press release from NCDC. Treatment of Lassa fever cases is also ongoing at designated treatment centres across the Risk communication and community engagement activities continue in the states. National awareness was improved through the recently concluded international Lassa fever conference which took place from 16 through 17 January 2019.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nLassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.\n\nAlthough Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June, the current increase in new confirmed cases and deaths should be monitored closely and addressed appropriately. Cases in neigbouring Benin and Togo potentially originating from Nigeria have been reported in previous years and therefore neighbouring countries should be monitored accordingly.\n\nWith twelve confirmed cases so far among healthcare workers, there is evidence of nosocomial transmission of the disease amidst reports of inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) supplied in some health facilities and complacency on the part of health workers towards maintaining IPC measures.\n\nWHO advice\n\nPrevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. WHO continues to advice all countries in the Lassa fever belt on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate as well as strengthen cross-border collaboration.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the currently available information.

I thought that it is just a propaganda and it will not affect Muslims. But now, I understand that it is not a fake story. It is a real risk. Anyone can be infected by coronavirus. If we follow the advice, which I heard from the audio messages, we can save our lives.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Emam Hossain, a 35-year-old Rohingya refugee in Ukhiya. Emam is one of many Rohingya refugees who heard a COVID-19 audio message at a health facility in the camps. Communications with Communities (CwC) Working Group partners identified health facilities in Photo: CAID/ DAM the camps and nearby host communities as a strategic point for information dissemination and have been broadcasting messages on COVID-19 symptoms, risk prevention, and seeking treatment, to dispel misinformation in the community. Almost all health facilities are now playing audio/video messages, which is significantly raising awareness and understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Read more\n\nKey COVID-19 figures this week1\n\nMonsoon-related Incidents2 reported this week\n\nCOVID-19 data on Cox\u2019s Bazar District is sourced from WHO daily update. Please note that confirmed COVID-19 cases and number of fatalities are cumulative. All numbers are indicative only, as reported to SMSD Sector following rapid assessments carried out on the day of the incident. The numbers are not verified. Households and/or individuals directly affected by a specific incident, including people injured, relocated, displaced and with damaged shelters. These estimates do not include people who are indirectly affected ex. by not being able to access affected facilities. SMSD Sector cannot confirm that drownings resulted from the monsoon, however, the data captures all incidents (windstorm, slope failure, lightning, flood and drowning) reported in the camps during the monsoon season.\n\nISCG COVID-19 and Monsoon Weekly Update #24, 14 to 20 August 2020 | 2\n\nThis week, a new SARI ITC opened in the camps, bringing it to a toal of 13 SARI ITCs with a capacity of 490 beds that were active and receiving patients. The Health Sector, with the support of WHO, continued case management and infection prevention and control (IPC) trainings for humanitarian and health workers in all upazilas5, and have so far trained 102 humanitarian and healthcare workers in five upazilas. During the week, COVID-19 testing of refugees continued to increase: 878 refugees were tested, compared to 699 in the previous week. In host communities, testing also increased with 490 tests conducted, compared to 459 in the previous week.\n\nWATER, SANITATION and HYGIENE (WASH)\n\nWASH Sector partners reached 242,983 individuals through a neighbourhood- based approach and 248,516 individuals through mass media with COVID-19 awareness messages in host and Rohingya communities. In the camps, WASH Sector partners provided soap to 25,273 households and family hygiene kits to 13,786 households, and installed a total of 1,854 hand-washing stations (HWS), including 96 HWS with stools and buckets at household-level, 15 HWS at public spaces, and 1,743 tippy taps at public places and near toilet facilities. As part of COVID-19 risk prevention measures and IPC compliance in the host communities and camps, WASH Sector partners disinfected 63,365 WASH facilities and 3,473 public buildings.\n\nCOMMUNICATION with COMMUNITIES (CwC WG)\n\nCwC WG partners organized 32 cascade training sessions on COVID-19 with 63 staff and volunteers. CwC WG partners reached 275,107 people in the camps and host communities with key COVID-19 messages through community engagement activities, including 45,456 neighbourhood-based sessions; 24,637 community consultation meetings; 685 listening group sessions; 493 video/film viewings; and 8,395 sessions led by religious leaders. CwC WG partners organised COVID-19 awareness announcements via loudspeakers/megaphones in 21 camps. For receiving community feedback/complaints, 92 information service centres in the camps and 4 information service centres in the host community were operational. 5 new audio messages and 1 video on COVID-19 were developed by CwC WG partners.",

    "text": "13799\n\nAs global lead of the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC), the World Food Programme (WFP) is convening the Emergency Telecommunications Sector (ETS) in Nigeria, responding with government, private sector and humanitarian partners on the ground to ensure a coordinated response. ETS SitReps are issued monthly.\n\nThe Global Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) Coordinator visited the ETS\n\nin Nigeria to engage\n\nstakeholders and identify areas of collaboration.\n\nTo accommodate increasing connectivity needs as part of the expansion of the humanitarian hub\n\nin Banki, the ETS shipped an additional satellite\n\nThe ETS Coordinator participated in a WFP- organised donors meeting in Abuja on 23 May to showcase the ETS project progress and discuss planned activities.\n\nSituation Overview\n\nAs reported by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) at the end of May, a recent spike in violence in north-western parts of Nigeria has forced an estimated 20,000 people to seek safety and security in Niger since April. Nigerians are fleeing due to multiple reasons, including clashes between farmers and herders of\n\ndifferent ethnic groups, vigilantism, as well as kidnappings. Many of the newly arrived are located very close to the Nigerian border, where there remains a high risk of armed incursions.\n\nAccording to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on 21 May 2019 the Nigerian military commenced a unilateral relocation of civilian populations from Sabon Gari, a border community in Damboa Local Government Area (LGA) of Borno State to the Government Science Secondary School and Unity camps for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Damboa Town, located some 85 kilometers south-west of Maiduguri, the state capital, citing safety and security reasons. Sabon Gari community is a border town linking Damboa LGA with Biu LGA and has witnessed an escalation of attacks and clashes between Non-State Armed Groups (NSAGs) and government forces in recent weeks.\n\nETS Response\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the ETS has provided Internet connectivity services to over 2,300 humanitarians from 76 organisations at the hubs deployed across North-East Nigeria.\n\nThe Global ETC Coordinator, Jalal Shah, visited the ETS Nigeria operation in the last week of May. He met with stakeholders in Abuja before travelling to Maiduguri on Tuesday 28 May. In Maiduguri, he engaged with the ETS team and with key partners involved in the response to discuss the way forward of the ETS project in North-East Nigeria. He also visited the humanitarian hub in Dikwa on Wednesday 29 May to check first-hand the ETS infrastructure setup and services available to the humanitarian community.\n\nThe ETS started engaging with the main mobile network operators (MNOs) in North-East Nigeria to update the coverage maps and reflect current communications services from local providers in Borno, Yobe and\n\nAdamawa states. Additionally, the ETS engaged with MNOs to gather proposals for a bulk SMS system to\n\nsupport UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) activities.\n\nThe ETS conducted a 3-day mission in Dikwa to improve HF communications at the hub. In addition, an Iridium Push-To-Talk docking station was installed at the bunker and the ETS programmed all International Organization for Migration (IOM) communications equipment in the bunker to ensure their full operability.\n\nMoreover, maintenance works were conducted on the ETS services in Bama.\n\nThe ETS supported UNDSS in Maiduguri during the interview process of 30x candidates for Radio Operators positions to man the Security Operations Centres (SOCs) across North-East Nigeria.\n\nThe ETS delivered a training on security communications procedures to 20x OCHA staff members and 1x UN Development Programme (UNDP) driver in Maiduguri. During the reporting period, the ETS also trained 33 humanitarians from nine organisations on security communications procedures during a Safe and Secure Approaches to Field Environments (SSAFE) organised in Maiduguri.",

WFP also signed an interinstitutional agreement with Carchi State Polytechnic University for a cooperation framework to implement the project.\n\nWFP supported specialized shelters for survivors of violence, through the donation of highchairs for toddles residing in the facilities.\n\n77,555 migrants benefited from WFP\u2019s food vouchers in July. The majority were Venezuelans (93 percent), followed by Colombians (6.7 percent). Since April, this\n\nassistance has been complemented by an\n\nadditional monthly value of USD 5 per person, for the purchase of necessary hygiene products, thanks to a UNICEF\u2019s contribution. Due to the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, this agreement was extended to September\n\n1,018 people, 46 percent from Venezuela, were assisted at shelters and canteens managed by partner organizations.\n\nThe one-time food assistance at the border provinces, Sucumb\u00edos, Carchi and El Oro remains suspended due to the border closure.\n\nWFP provided support to UNHCR for cargo transportation to Lago Agrio.\n\n\u2022 Complement the Government's social protection strategy by providing Cash-Based Transfers to the most vulnerable populations and support in vulnerability analysis and knowledge\n\n\u2022 Support and increase the participation of smallholder farmer organizations in national and local commercial mechanisms and institutional markets. \u2022 Strengthen the capacity of farmer organizations.\n\n\u2022 Strengthen or develop emergency preparedness, response, and early warning systems. \u2022 Strengthen the implementation of adaptation and resilience\n\n\u2022 Technical assistance, research and assessments, to improve the implementation of programs linked to food security and nutrition. \u2022 Knowledge management and sharing of best practices and studies, including through South-South cooperation.\n\n\u2022 Provide technical assistance and services through the logistics sector to the National Disaster Management Offices and relevant partners to improve emergency logistics coordination and supply chain management.\n\nWFP Ecuador Country Brief August 2020\n\nThe number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reached is 113,767 as of 31 August, having Quito as epicenter.\n\nAs the COVID-19 cases relentlessly surge at a rapid pace, the national government has put new restrictions to 18 provinces until 31 August. Consequently, the national health emergency got extended until 13\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has newly presented its economic forecast that Ecuador may become the second worst-hit country in the region after Peru, with a 10.9 percent drop in its GDP in 2020.\n\nThe nationwide underemployment and unemployment rates have soared while the adequate employment rate has plunged by half, which could possibly trigger a great increase in food insecurity countrywide and further raise the poverty level.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, most Venezuelan migrants are spatially clustered in Ecuador, unlike in other Latin American host countries. The Migration Policy Institute also estimates that Ecuador may have the largest proportion of irregular migrants in the region. Likewise, food insecure populations in remote areas, particularly during the pandemic, are difficult to locate.",

Jolie. June 2021.\n\nKEY INDICATORS\n\nFUNDING (AS OF 22 JUNE 2021)\n\nOPERATIONAL UPDATE > Burkina Faso / 1 May - 30 June 2021\n\nOPERATIONAL CONTEXT UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is deeply concerned by the humanitarian consequences of recent violence in Burkina Faso. The intensification of hostilities between non-state armed groups and the Defense and Security Forces and their auxiliaries, as well as targeted attacks, continue to seriously affect the protection of the civilian population. During the reporting period, the security situation in the Center-North, East, North and Sahel, North regions, deteriorated at an alarming rate, with direct impacts on civilians. In fact, the reporting period saw the deadliest attack since 2015 \u2013 with 138 men, women and children killed in the village of Solhan in the Sahel region. Recently, humanitarians also have been affected by the violence. On the road between the town of Dori and Goudoubo refugee camp, a convoy by UNHCR\u2019s health partner International Health Support Center (CSSI) and a UNHCR vehicle were attacked in two separate incidents. Luckily, both UNHCR and its partner staffs involved did not sustain any injuries. Insecurity is also growing in the East region. During the reporting period, an attack on the village of Kodyel in the East region, resulted in almost 6,000 people fleeing towards neighboring towns. Violence in the East region has led to rising displacements, including people fleeing across the border to Benin.\n\nMAIN ACHIEVEMENTS \u25a0 The results of the protection monitoring for the months of April and May indicate an overall escalation of violence against civilians in the regions of the North, Center-North, East, and Sahel regions. The most common violations include those related to the right to liberty and security of the person (almost 1,500), to property (1,180), to psychological integrity (414), to life (246) and GBV (120). Almost 3,200 violations were committed by armed groups. Food, medical care, housing, drinkable water, documentation, and psychosocial support are amongst the main needs of displaced populations. Land disputes, evictions and the increase in housing prices in towns which saw the arrival of IDPs are the largest issues in all regions. The response provided in the framework of protection monitoring includes psychosocial support (36%), cash assistance (17%) and referral (47%) to appropriate care and services. \u25a0 From 7 to 9 June, in the Cascades and Hauts-Bassins regions, UNHCR trained 13 monitors (assistant and project managers) from the International Committee for Emergency Aid and Development (CIAUD Canada), on international protection in the context of mixed movements and on migration data collection techniques through the Kobo platform \u2013 a tool used for data collection on the field using mobile devices such as mobile phones or tablets. Following the training, the monitors were deployed, and identified 133\n\nOPERATIONAL UPDATE > Burkina Faso / 1 May - 30 June 2021\n\npeople in mixed movements. These people were profiled and referred to the appropriate care structures, particularly the Humanitarian Action services. \u25a0 As part of its efforts to reduce the risk of statelessness in the country as well as to strengthen resilience and unlock solutions for IDPs by facilitating their access to rights and to services, UNHCR and its Government counterpart Directorate-General for the Modernization of Civil Status (DGMEC) launched a new pilot tool which will allow for the instantaneous provision of birth certificates for IDPs and host communities. In addition, in the region of Boucle du Mouhoun, UNHCR and DGMEC providing some 800 birth certificates to IDPs and host communities. \u25a0 UNHCR significantly expanded its prioritization on Community-based Protection (CBP), Digital Engagement and Community-led Connectivity Solutions through two new projects. UNHCR will on the one hand facilitate the establishment of a Community Hotspot, which will allow communities to access a dedicated connectivity infrastructure and be organized around its management and planning and on the other hand, allow, through its partner VIAMO, the creation and dissemination of messages on CPB, Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP), Protection from Sexual Misconduct and peaceful coexistence through the use of the Interactive Voice Response technology.",

    "text": "2913\n\nFIGHTING ESCALATES ON THE WEST COAST\n\nArmed clashes are continuing along the Al Hudaydah coastline with significant advancement by forces supported by the Saudi-led Coalition (SLC) towards Al Hudaydah City. As of 28 May, fierce clashes were continuing between armed elements in Ad Durayhimi District. Intensive airstrikes were reported in areas where clashes are ongoing as well as in At Tuhayat District.\n\nAl Hudaydah governorate\n\nNo major displacement has been observed during the Qanawis reporting period. Since 12 May, an estimated 750 households have fled military operations mostly from Al Haymah and the Al Mighlaf outskirts of Al Tuhayat District to Bayt Al Faqiah, Zabid and Al Garrahi Districts. As frontlines shift quickly in areas where Bajil fighting is taking place, people living in these areas are understood to be mainly relocating within the same districts Al Hajjaylah before returning to their villages once the violence has Al Hali subsided. As Sukhnah 140,000 more people are at risk of displacement Durayhimi Humanitarian partners estimate that some 140,000 more Bayt Al people are at risk of being displaced from the three southern Al Hudaydah districts \u2013 Zabid, Al Garrahi and At Tuhayat. If the conflict reaches Al Hudaydah City, projections are that an additional 200,000 people are likely to be displaced, mostly within Al Hudaydah Governorate. Legend Humanitarian partners in Aden and Al Hudaydah hubs have District border ramped up the delivery of assistance to accessible areas \u00b7\u00b0 and are refining contingency plans in anticipation that humanitarian needs will increase as the conflict expands across the west coast. In Al Khawkhah and Hays Districts, needs have become increasingly stabilized by the growing engagement of Aden-based responders. During the reporting period, food, NFI, WASH, and cash assistance has been delivered to displaced families sheltering in Jabal Ra\u2019s, Zabid and Bait Al Faqiah districts, as well as in Al Hudaydah City. Despite shifting frontlines and intensified airstrikes, more resources and capacity are being mobilized to sustain the ongoing humanitarian response. Negotiations to access people in need, regardless of where they are, are continuing from all concerned hubs. This includes facilitating and negotiating humanitarian access to populations caught behind frontlines or trapped by crossfire.\n\nEscalating clashes reported in Taizz Governorate As far as the situation in Taizz Governorate is concerned, armed clashes have reportedly intensified in the eastern parts of Taizz City and in the western front in Maqbanah and Al-Ma\u2019afir Districts. The Ibb Health Sub-Cluster is supporting three frontline hospitals (Al-Barh and Hajdah Hospitals in Maqbanah District and Aoon Hospital in Shara\u00e1b Al-Salam District) with medical supplies to prepare for the possible casualties from areas affected by violence. The shift in frontlines in western Taizz has, however, opened humanitarian access to Al Wazi\u2019iah and Mawza Districts from the cities of Al Turba and Aden.\n\nAFTERMATH OF CYCLONE MEKUNU\n\nIn order to respond to the needs created by the impact of cyclone \u201cMekunu\u201d humanitarian partners are dispatching a consignment of emergency supplies to Hadibo including 10.5 Mt of food supplies, emergency medical supplies, 1,000 shelter/NFI kits, 4,000 hygiene kits, 35 water bladders and supplies of chlorine to purify water. A UN team is scheduled to fly to Socotra on 29 May to work with the local authorities in further assessing needs and coordinating response efforts. OCHA Flash Update on cyclone\u201d Mekunu\u201d can be found here: https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-\n\nUPDATES FROM THE HUBS\n\nAden: Humanitarian partners in the Aden Hub have conducted several assessments and are scaling up their response to needs in the southern governorates. A recent humanitarian mission to Mukalla found that new IDPs, of whom women and children are the most- affected, urgently need health care, food, education for children, safe portable water and shelter support and dignity kits for women. In Abyan and Lahj governorates, a response to the recent rapid needs assessment conducted by an INGO is ongoing. Sub-national clusters have provided hygiene kits, water supplies, food rations, psychosocial support, cash assistance, health support, and nutrition assistance through mobile teams. Given the fact that the hub is coordinating the response to needs in Socotra Island caused by cyclone \u201cMekunu\u201d \u2013 and some of the supplies might be diverted to the Hudaydah response - the team is reviewing the status of the relief stock.",

    "text": "43276\n\nAs of 24 October, 3,941 COVID-19 cases were reported in Somalia with 104 fatalities and 3,166 recoveries (352 new cases since last month). While the overall number of cases in UNICEF health facilities decreased since the previous reporting period, supported health centres in Somaliland documented a 55 percent increase in suspected COVID-19 cases. According to the COVID-19 data released by WHO, 191 health care workers tested positive and two died of COVID- 19, as of 30 September in Somalia. Delivery of lifesaving essential health services across Somalia remains UNICEF\u2019s priority; with 77,920 children and women receiving essential healthcare services and 27,689 mothers and care givers provided with IYCF counseling services in the reporting period. During the reporting period,101,231 people were reached with WASH services, including 41,626 people reached with hygiene kits in Mudug, Middle Shabelle, Hiraan and Bay Since the start of the response in March, more than 141,800 children have been reached with alternative learning through radio, TV and online learning platform.\n\nUS $ 35 Million needed to\n\nFunding Overview\n\nUNICEF\u2019s COVID-19 appeal is US$ 35 million with US$ 22 million in funding received to date. In addition to the resources mobilized, UNICEF has reprogrammed US$1.1 million from existing funds. UNICEF Somalia faces a funding gap of US$12.1 million (35 per cent of the funding requirement) - as needs continue to grow, UNICEF Somalia welcomes predictable and flexible funding to respond effectively and efficiently to the COVID-19 crisis and to the continuation of essential lifesaving services for women and children in the country.\n\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Need\n\nOn 24 October, the Ministry of Health reported that the total confirmed COVID-19 cases reached 3,941 with 104 deaths. Though children account for below 4.7 percent of the total confirmed cases in Somalia, the overall ARI/pneumonia cases in UNICEF supported health facilities increased marginally from 8,499 (Aug/Sept) to 8,655 (Sept/Oct) and Somaliland health facilities also saw a 99 percent surge in cases with unclassified fever.\n\nThis is consistent with the observed increase in COVID-19 positive cases within the Somaliland regions and it is timely that Somaliland MoH-led COVID-19 trainings have now commenced.\n\nWHO reported that as of 30 September, 191 health care workers were tested positive while two died of COVID-19 in Somalia. Considering the high underreporting rate in the country due to the weak surveillance systems in hospital settings to report infections in health care workers, stigma associated with testing and other associated factors, WHO\u2019s report indicated that the actual number of health workers infected with COVID-19 might be higher than what has been reported. The impact of the COVID-19 infection among the health workers on the health system needs further assessment.\n\nUNICEF in collaboration with the Government and other humanitarian actors continued to support the continuity of the health services in the country. During the reporting period, UNICEF partners trained 504 frontline health workers on COVID-19 related issues, 440 health facility staff on IPC protocols and 192 community health workers on COVID-19 awareness, protection and case detection across the country. UNICEF and partners continued their efforts to ensure patient and staff safety and to sensitize communities, including equipping 658 health personnel with masks and gloves, 239 frontline health workers with gowns and face shields, and social mobilizers sensitized 36,032 care givers, conducted 11,757 hand-washing demonstrations and held 1,330 community meetings.\n\nIn addition to the ongoing crisis of the pandemic, Somalia continues to deal with a complex evolving situation in managing already scarce and overstretched resources. It is expected that the desert locusts, the upcoming below average rainfall, compounded by COVID, will contribute towards the deterioration of production outputs, increasing vulnerabilities of households and will further aggravate the already poor malnutrition status of children. According to FSNAU report, 2.1 million people across Somalia are expected to face Crisis level or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) outcomes between now and December without sustained humanitarian assistance.",

Saad\n\nWith the world in the grip of COVID-19 pandemic other emergencies risk drifting to the back of people\u2019s minds. One long- standing emergency is the war and conflict in Syria, which has claimed at least 500 000 lives and left an estimated 11 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.1 In the Northwest of the country, in the Idlib and Northern Aleppo governorates, four million people, of which two- thirds are displaced from other parts of Syria, are currently in the midst of a humanitarian crisis due to a mili- tary campaign by Syrian and Russian govern- ment forces.3 In the Northeast, the plight of many in detention and refugee or inter- nally displaced people (IDP) camps appears forgotten. To compound this complex situa- tion further, COVID-19 has now also arrived in Syria, including in the Northeast. At the time of writing, in Syria, 124 cases and 6 deaths have been reported.4 Here, I aim to describe the situation in one of the refugee/ IDP camps in Northeast Syria, the Al Hol camp, based on my experiences there from May to August 2019 as an epidemiologist with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), to raise awareness about the health and humanitarian\n\nHISTORY OF THE AL HOL CAMP The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) occupied large parts of Syria and Iraq and terrorised hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Syrians living under their occupation. A coalition emerged in September 2014 to uproot ISIS, with Kurdish and Iraqi forces slowly reclaiming lost territory in a drawn- out war. In March 2019, the last ISIS enclave, Baghouz, was overrun by Kurdish troops and the caliphate was declared defeated.6 During the retreat of ISIS and after the fall of the caliphate, refugee and IDP camps were estab- lished across the Northeast to shelter those who had recently lived under ISIS\u2019s control\n\nor were perceived to be the partners, children and relatives of male ISIS members. Three of these camps, of which the largest is the Al Hol camp, also contained foreign nationals, including Europeans who joined ISIS. The Al Hol camp, close to the Syria\u2013Iraq border, was initially set up by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees during the 1991 Gulf war for approximately 15 000 people and it expanded further during the US invasion of Iraq in the early 2000s. In 2018, the camp hosted roughly 10 000 Iraqi refugees but this grew to approximately 73 000, between December 2018 and March 2019, largely surpassing the capacity, due to a mass influx of refugees and IDP. When I arrived in May 2019, an estimated 11 000 of the 73 000 were third- country nationals, defined as neither Syrian nor Iraqi, and over 94% were women and children.8 Between December 2018 and March 2019, the new arrivals to the camp were transported from the Deir Al- Zour area, which was previ- ously controlled by ISIS, through a series of security screening points. At the screening points, all men of fighting age, including adolescents above 14\u201315 years, were sepa- rated from their families and imprisoned. Only, women and children were allowed passage to the camp.9 Generally, newcomers first stay at a reception area and remain there until allocated a shelter and being",

Between 15 and 18\n\nNovember, 23 new cases were reported in the southern provinces of Moyen-Chari, Logone oriental, Mayo-Kebbi est and Mayo-Kebbi ouest, and in the capital N\u2019Djamena. All new cases are contact cases or suspected cases. The pandemic has been steadily on the rise with an average 63 new cases per week over the past six weeks. On 16 November, the Government extended the curfew for another 14 days in all previously concerned provinces and localities (Gu\u00e9ra, Kanem, Logone occidental, Logone oriental, Mayo-Kebbi ouest, Mayo-Kebbi est,\n\nand N\u2019Djamena, Mandelia, Logone-Gana, N\u2019Djamena-Farah), from 7pm until 5am for Moyen-Chari and Mayo-\n\nKebbi ouest, and from 9pm until 5am for the rest.\n\nPOPULATION MOVEMENTS\n\nLac province Disruption of food distribution to IDPs: Between July and October 2020, an estimated 24,000 Internally Displaced People (IDPs) in Daboua and Ngouboua were affected by the disruption of food distributions. WFP has announced the immediate availability of food stocks and the resumption of distribution operations. Cash\n\ndistributions continued during the interruption of food distribution which helped mitigate vulnerability risk for households. As the number of IDPs in the Lac province increases, so do their humanitarian needs. Round 13 of the IOM-led Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), covering 218 displacement locations between 11 September\n\nand 5 October, revealed that the number of IDPs in the Lac increased by 13 per cent as compared to round 12 : the total number of IDPs in the Lac province is 336,124, which represents approximately half of the entire Lac\n\nOver 1,000 deportations from Libya in the past seven months: On 14 November, 84 people, all Chadian men, including three minors and three people with a physical disability, arrived in the town of Ounianga Kebir, located near the Libyan border. Most of them reported having been imprisoned in Libya before their deportation. Upon arrival, these individuals were placed in quarantine at the IOM transit center, in accordance with measures taken by the Chadian authorities to prevent and contain the spread of COVID-19. With 54 individuals already deported last 9 November, a total of 138 individuals are currently in quarantine in Ounianga Kebir. IOM reports\n\n1,031 deportations - the majority from north-east Libya - since mid-April 2020. These people arrive in a state of extreme vulnerability. IOM provides them with food, water and NFIs and helps them go back to their original area after quarantine.\n\nLogone oriental province Access restrictions lifted after mediation from OCHA: After almost two weeks during which a visa was requested for mission orders from humanitarians in the Nya Pende department, the prefect has lifted the measure. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread in the southern provinces, with several humanitarian staff having tested positive in early November, local authorities had decided to apply stricter movement restrictions, in\n\naddition to the curfew already in place. The prefect of the Nya Pende department had requested that a visa be\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.

OCHA met with local authorities,\n\nincluding the prefect, several times over the past few days, advocating for the lifting of this measure which hinders humanitarian access and reinforces stigma towards humanitarian workers. On 16 November, the prefect agreed to lift the visa restriction and to let humanitarian and private vehicles circulate freely if plate numbers and names of organizations are registered with security forces upon entrance in the city. The humanitarian community is rigorously applying preventive measures against COVID-19, in offices and out, and systematically testing potential contacts among the staff, in order to curb the spread of the virus.",

    "text": "43622\n\nNICARAGUA AND HONDURAS Hurricane Eta\n\nBriefing note 11 November 2020\n\nCRISIS IMPACT OVERVIEW\n\n\u2022 On Tuesday 3 November, Hurricane Eta made landfall on the North Atlantic coast of Nicaragua \u2013 just south of the city of Bilwi (also known as Puerto Cabezas) \u2013 as a category 4 hurricane, with heavy rainfall and high winds of up to 230km/h (OCHA 03/11/2020). As the hurricane moved further inland and was downgraded to a tropical storm, it exposed Honduras and other Central American countries to heavy rains that have resulted in widespread flooding and deadly landslides (AccuWeather 05/11/2020; IFRC 09/11/2020).\n\nThe North Atlantic coast of Nicaragua bore the brunt of the hurricane and people there have urgent needs. These are aggravated by pre-existing vulnerabil- ities and the remoteness of affected communities, which have limited response efforts (OCHA 04/11/2020). The situation is even more critical in Honduras, where almost 1.8 million people have been directly affected and 38 have been killed by flooding and landslides (OCHA 08/11/2020).\n\nThe hurricane has caused widespread damage to roads, bridges, houses, and power lines, leaving people cut off from assistance and with urgent shelter, non-food item (NFI), food, and WASH needs (AccuWeather 05/11/2020; Reuters 03/11/2020; OCHA 03/11/2020).\n\nThe impacts of the hurricane reach far beyond the areas directly hit by the storm. Heavy rains have triggered flooding and landslides in Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador, Panama, Costa Rica, and Belize. Guatemala is the third worst-hit country after Nicaragua and Honduras. In Guatemala, flooding has affected\n\nover 311,000 people and almost 10,000 are currently in shelters (OCHA 09/11/2020). Landslides have killed at least 31 people with the death toll expected to rise as 100 more remain missing (CONRED 09/11/2020; IFRC 09/11/2020). At least 27 people have also died in southern states in Mexico (ECHO 09/11/2020).\n\nANTICIPATED SCOPE AND SCALE\n\nHurricane Eta has now cleared Central America and has turned back over the Caribbean Sea. Persistent rainfall and resulting floods across Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and parts of Costa Rica, Panama, and Belize have affected up to three million people across the region (OCHA As forecasted, the system strengthened again as it headed north- east across the Caribbean Sea. It hit Cuba on Sunday 8 November and caused flooding in coastal zones, but no deaths have been reported (Al Jazeera 08/11/2020). The storm reached Florida on Sunday night with high winds and heavy rains. The US National Hurricane Center has de- clared hurricane and storm surge warnings for parts of Florida (The Guardian 09/11/2020). The Atlantic hurricane season officially lasts until the end of November, but meteorologists have warned that threats could remain well into De- cember (AccuWeather 05/11/2020).\n\nHUMANITARIAN CONSTRAINTS\n\nFlooding and landslides have damaged roads and bridges and severed power supplies in both Honduras and Nicaragua, cutting off 68 commu- nities (95,000 people) in Honduras and at least three communities in Nic- aragua from physical access and telecommunications (IFRC 09/11/2020; OCHA 08/11/2020; AccuWeather 05/11/2020; Reuters 03/11/2020). In some affected areas in Honduras, gang members are extorting people and restricting access to humanitarian workers (OCHA 08/11/2020). Several Nicaraguan NGOs and community groups have reported that the government has obstructed efforts to collect and distribute donations for affected communities (Confidencial 05/11/2020; El Peri\u00f3dico 05/11/2020; La Vanguardia 05/11/2020). The North Atlantic is an autonomous region of Nicaragua and there are tensions between the affected Miskita and Mayagna communities in this region and the Nicaraguan state.\n\nCRISIS IMPACT\n\nNicaragua: High winds have damaged houses in the affected areas. According to the Nation- al System for Prevention, Mitigation and Attention of Disasters (SINAPRED), approximately 47,000 people are sheltering in different sites including family homes, churches, and schools",

This led to significant delays, and therefore demurrage costs, for vessels linking regional ports, which only spend one or two days at sea between ports. COVID-19 mitigation measures delayed the arrangements by the financial service provider (FSP) for unrestricted cash distributions, as well as the food prepositioning for in-kind and commodity vouchers assistances. This has led to delays in programme implementation.\n\nDonors (in alphabetical order): Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, European Commission, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Korea (Rep. of), Kuwait, Luxembourg, Norway, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, UN CERF, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Yemen Humanitarian Fund and private sector donors.",

Desert locust swarms remain present across parts of Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea, and Yemen. Desert locusts continue to seriously impact Yemen and other areas of the sub-\n\n2. Above-average rainfall since July has caused widespread flooding across Sudan, South Sudan, and Ethiopia. The additional forecast rainfall is likely to maintain a high flood 4. Heavy rainfall over the past several weeks has caused flooding across Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Nigeria. Heavy rainfall forecast for next week is likely to increase the risk of continued flooding.\n\nFEWS NET is a USAID-funded activity.

At the same time, many Sahelian countries continued to receive light to moderate rainfall. Areas in Liberia, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Nigeria recorded some more moderate to locally heavy rainfall, with the largest amounts recorded in southern Nigeria (Figure 1). In Ghana, heavy rainfall triggered significant flooding in the south. Despite elevated risks for flooding, the recent rainfall alleviated abnormal dryness, which has affected the Gulf of Guinea over the past few months. During the past 30-days, parts of Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, and Togo have shown small to moderate rainfall deficits, while West Africa has received favorable rainfall.\n\nNext week, heavy rainfall is forecast for Guinea-Conakry and Cameroon, increasing the risk of flooding and exacerbating conditions over previously-flooded areas. Light rainfall is generally expected across Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Niger, which could trigger additional flooding in previously flooded\n\nThe Horn of Africa experiences a favorable June-September rainy season An analysis of the June-September rainfall performance has shown a mostly favorable seasonal rainfall over the Horn of Africa. Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, northeastern DRC, southwestern Kenya, northern Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea, coastal and northwestern Somalia, and Yemen recorded seasonal rainfall surpluses. Over the past 30-days, the region has experienced a similar seasonal rainfall pattern, with western and eastern Sudan and northern Ethiopia recording the largest surpluses (Figure 2). Flooding and overflowing rivers have affected several parts of Sudan, South Sudan, and Ethiopia. Flooding has affected the majority of states in South Sudan. Similarly, in Ethiopia, flooding and overflowing river levels have affected the Afar and Amhara regions. In contrast, over the past 30-days below-average rainfall persists in northern and east-central Ethiopia.\n\nA recent basin excess rainfall analysis depicted that very high potential for flooding continued over central and eastern Sudan, western Eritrea, and northeastern Ethiopia. Moderate to high flood risks also existed across South Sudan, northern DRC, northern Uganda, and western Ethiopia. With the continuation of late-season and above-average rains, chances for flooding are likely to continue.\n\nNext week, heavy rainfall is forecast in western Ethiopia, western South Sudan, and western Uganda, while in eastern South Sudan, eastern Ethiopia, and northern Somalia, light to moderate rainfall is expected. Light rainfall is expected elsewhere. Decreased rainfall should help relieve wetness and oversaturation over some parts of Sudan.",

On the overnight of 25-26, grad and mortar shells were reportedly fired on residential areas in Al Hadhba, in Abusliem, and Al Sidrah municipalities, with unconfirmed reports of casualties and material damages reported. OCHA received a report from the Mayor of Abusliem that one civilian sustained injuries in the shelling and that there might be unexploded ordnance in populated areas in Abusliem resulting from the attack. This information was referred to UNMAS for their follow up. On the night of 27-28 April, airstrikes were also reported to have impacted in residential areas, including in Ain Zara and Al Twaisha area of Tripoli, with unconfirmed reports of at least one civilian death, as well as damage to civilian buildings and homes. Airstrikes impacting a military base located in the vicinity of the Alfallah I & II IDP camps in Tawerga were also reported, with no civilian casualties reported. Elsewhere, armed clashes, shelling and airstrikes continued along established frontlines. Verified civilian casualty figures remain unchanged as of this reporting, with no new civilian casualties verified since 25 April. Since the beginning of the conflict at least 90 civilian casualties, including 21 fatalities have been verified.2 These casualties include medical personnel, women and children, and at least one foreign national.\n\n\uf0b7 On 25 April UNHCR and IOM completed the evacuation of all refugees and migrants from Qasr Bin Ghasheer Detention Centre (DC), transferring 327 refugees and migrants to Azzawaya DC. In total, 655 individuals (519 men, 108 women and 28 children) were transferred from Qasr Bin Ghasheer DC to Azzawaya DC on 24-25 April. On 23 April, 12 detainees sustained injuries that required hospitalization when an armed group entered Qasr Bi Ghasheer DC. Upon arrival at Azzawaya DC, UNHCR provided counselling, registration, NFIs and medical assistance through its partner IMC. Qasr Bin Ghasheer was one of nine DCs located in areas exposed to or at risk of clashes, two of which have now been completely evacuated. 3,343 refugees and migrants remain trapped in DCs considered to be exposed to or at risk of armed conflict. Additionally, a DTM-IOM Rapid Assessment finds that a significant population of urban migrants and refugees are present in conflict affected areas, at risk from armed conflict and subject to a lack of freedom of movement and impaired access to markets/food.",

    "text": "13679\n\nDTM SITUATION UPDATE URBAN MIGRANTS\n\n06 MAY 2019\n\nSince the onset of armed conflict in the southern areas of Tripoli on 04 April 2019, at least 11,220 Libyan families (approximately 56,100 individuals) have been displaced from their homes as of 05 May. In addition, more than 3,460 migrants remain in detention centers in proximity to conflict-affected areas and are among the most vulnerable populations at risk.\n\nFurthermore, there is a significant population of urban migrants also present in the affected areas. Urban migrants in the context of the ongoing conflict also constitute a particularly vulnerable group and their protection remains a concern.\n\nIn the last week of April, DTM conducted a second rapid assessment on the extent to which the ongoing conflict has affected the situation of urban migrants. The assessment covered the areas of Abusliem, Ain Zara, Khallat Al Furjan, Salah Eddin, Hai Alandalus, Qasr Bin Ghashir, Suq Aljumaa, and Tajoura for a second time, while the areas of Janzour, Swani bin Adam, and Tripoli Center were also included. The rapid assessment gathered information along a set of proxy indicators via key informant interviews. The proxy indicators chosen were identified to determine the impact of armed conflict on the migrant\u2019s safety in the areas assessed; freedom of movement; access to jobs, consumer markets, and food. This brief situation update presents the key findings of the rapid assessment.\n\nLOCATIONS COVERED:\n\nAIN ZARA, KHALLAT AL FURJAN, SALAH EDDIN, HAI ALANDALUS, QASR BIN GHASHIR, SUQ ALJUMAA, SWANI BIN ADAM, TRIPOLI CENTER\n\n(106 migrants) In proximity to conflict-affected area (indicative only)\n\n(564 migrants) (582 migrants) (644 migrants) (548 migrants) The designations employed and the presentation of material on this map do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the United Nations (and IOM) concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.\n\n*The term \u2018urban migrants\u2019 in this report refers to migrants (non-Libyan citizens) outside the detention centers. dtmlibya@iom.int www.globaldtm.info/libya\n\n06 MAY 2019\n\nThe impact of ongoing conflict on urban migrants was identified to be area specific. Similarly to Libyan households affected by the conflict, the adverse impact of conflict on the general situation of urban migrants depended strongly on their distance from the front line. More specifically, urban migrants in areas close to the conflict\u2019s front-line were observed to have been affected more than those located further away.\n\nTable 1: Overview of the findings of the urban migrant situation update. Impact Levels color coded based on the analysis of responses received to the proxy indicators where red implies Emergency, orange implies Crisis, and yellow implies Stressed. (Proximity to active clashes approximately measured from specific area\u2019s center to the most recent reported site of clashes.)\n\nOverall, while the general situation of migrants in all locations was determined to be affected by the armed conflict to varying extents, at 73% of the assessed locations key informants reported that migrants\u2019 freedom of movement was adversely affected by the ongoing armed conflict. This included the locations where migrants\u2019 freedom of movement was\n\n06 MAY 2019 partially affected and the areas where the migrants\u2019 freedom of movement was completely restricted due to proximity to ongoing clashes.\n\nFigure 1: Migrant\u2019s freedom of movement was reported to have been negatively affected by the ongoing conflict at 73% of the locations assessed.\n\nThis continued restricted freedom of movement due to the armed conflict limits migrants\u2019 options for evacuation and movement to safer locations, and therefore increases their vulnerability. In addition, for labor migrants working on daily wages the overall decline reported in the number of jobs available, as well as lack of access to markets and food, has further exacerbated their situation in the areas assessed.",

    "text": "21790\n\nIn June, the number of refugees and migrants from Venezuela reached the 4 million worldwide, with 3.2 million hosted in Latin America and the\n\n4 Million Venezuelans worldwide\n\nThe financial contributions towards the RMRP reached a 21% of the total requirements in June. A still low funding percentage towards the USD 737.6M requested in the Plan.\n\nNew entry requirements were implemented by Chile and Peru, while registration exercises took place in Trinidad and Tobago and\n\n3.2 Million Venezuelans living in Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nPage 1 of 6\n\nRegional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform > Situation Report \u2013 May/June 2019\n\nArea of Intervention 1: Direct emergency assistance Strategic outcome: Refugees and migrants are provided with life-saving goods and services.\n\nNeeds Assessments\n\nMonitoring exercises were conducted in Ecuador in partnership with the Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion (MIES). Results indicate that almost 40% of the 1,682 Venezuelan national interviewees report being in an irregular situation, while more than 37% indicated having a tourist visa or a \u201ctarjeta andina\u201d. The proportion of out-of-school children reported was of 41% of children aged between 5 to 11 and 53% of those aged 12 to 17 years.\n\nBasic Needs and Essential Services\n\nPartners have provided assistance to more than 8,000 refugees and migrants from Venezuela in Peru, Guyana, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, Argentina, Uruguay, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nTransportation assistance was provided to over 5,500 refugees and migrants from the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border to CEBAF and Tumbes, where approximately one fifth were referred to shelter support. More than 11,000 food and non- food kits were also provided in Peru.\n\nIn the area of food and nutrition, partners in the Caribbean (Guyana, Aruba, Curacao and Trinidad and Tobago) reached approximately 1,300 refugees and migrants from Venezuela with basic food and/or water. Temporary accommodation was also provided to 96 vulnerable refugees and migrants in Curacao, Dominican Republic, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. In the Southern Cone (Argentina and Uruguay), on the other hand, almost 40 refugees and migrants from Venezuela were provided with temporary accommodation and food assistance.\n\nHealth Services\n\nThe provision of emergency health services and assistance is a pressing need among Venezuelans across the region. In the Dominican Republic, 562 Venezuelans benefitted from individual medical consultations. In Guyana, 787 Venezuelans were immunized and vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), Yellow Fever and diphtheria before being granted stay permits. In Trinidad and Tobago, partners distributed 14 dignity kits to 13 Venezuelan and one Cuban woman, and 97 Venezuelans (75 women, 1 girl and 21 men) accessed sexual reproductive health services. In Panama, partners provided medicines (along with food vouchers and housing support) to 16 Venezuelan families, 73 persons received psychosocial assistance.\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\nRegional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform > Situation Report \u2013 May/June 2019\n\nOrientation and Information\n\nIn Costa Rica, information was provided regarding the possibility for migrant and refugee children to access to the national education system. Among these, partners selected 20 Venezuelan children - based on vulnerability criteria - and provided them with uniforms and school supplies. Partners also provided tutoring and academic support to primary and secondary students to help them enter the Costa Rican educational system.\n\nIn Mexico, partners launched an information campaign called \u201cConnecting Communities\u201d through social media sites. It included information on how to obtain work permits, carry out family reunification, access to basic education and revalidating academic degrees. The campaign is estimated to have reached an audience of over 90,000 persons.\n\nArea of Intervention 2: Protection Strategic outcome: Refugees and migrants enjoy rights and protection.",

    "text": "40790\n\nThe economic situation in Syria continued to deteriorate in September, driven by acute fuel shortages across the country. This is largely believed to be related to the collapse of the Syrian pound and the imposed sanctions on Syria that reduces the ability of the country to import fuel, exacerbated by the regular maintenance at the largest Syrian oil refinery, the Baniyas refinery, which supplied two-thirds of the country\u2019s gasoline needs. As a result of inadequate availability of fuel, Syrian authorities imposed further rationing of both subsidized and unsubsidized fuel: private vehicles were limited to fill 30 liters of gasoline every four days and the allocated purchase quantity of unsubsidized fuel reduced from 400 to 100 liters per month. This suggests further complications across Syria through increas- ing transportation costs, reducing commercial activities and fluctuations in food prices, highlighting eroding resilience of the population and people\u2019s purchasing power.\n\nMeanwhile, the emerging shortage of bread in bakeries has also affected Syria in September, especially the southern governorates, largely due to wheat flour scarcity across the country, electricity cuts, as well as the ongoing fuel crisis. Syria is estimated to consume 3.7\n\nmillion metric tons of wheat flour for national average food use, which is more than this year\u2019s production by around one million metric ton; highlighting the need for significant imports to cover the essential national demand. In response, Syrian authorities implement- ed a new distribution mechanism for subsidized bread, with an allocation between one to four bread bundles per family, per day, depending on household size. Meaning people need to seek out alternative staples or purchase bread from more expensive private baker- ies to meet their family\u2019s bread needs.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis continues to surge considerably in Syria. As of 30 September 2020, around 4,200 COVID-19 cases were confirmed across the country; marking a 55 percent increase compared to the national rate of COVID-19 cases at the end of August. Furthermore,\n\n90 percent of newly confirmed cases have not been traced to a known source, suggesting widespread community transmission. At the same time, the number of confirmed COVID-19 fatalities reached around 200 in September, representing almost a two-fold increase compared to the official announced death rate by the end of August. Infection rates among healthcare workers have been rising in Syria. As of 19 September 2020, around 143 healthcare workers were tested positive for COVID-19, which impacted the already over- stretched Syrian healthcare system.\n\nExplosive hazards and tensions between non-state armed groups were observed in northwest Syria. Multiple airstrikes were reported in Idleb and northern Aleppo, resulting in more than 4,000 people to have been displaced from southern Idlib towards Afrin, Darkosh and Salqin.\n\nThe majority of WFP assistance continues to be provided from within Syria, reaching around 4.8 million people in September 2020. Following the re-opening of schools across government-controlled areas on 13 September, WFP resumed its school feeding programme targeting more than 600,000 students across the country, initially reaching 22,300 students with daily fresh meals in Aleppo. Moreover, against the wheat flour backdrop, WFP launched a bakery rehabilitation project in Dar\u2019a, to further provide fresh bread to 40,000\n\nSources: Syrian Arab Republic: COVID-19 | September 2020, COAR | Syria Update September 2020, Syrian Arab Republic: Recent Development Report No.20 | September 2020, WFP Global Hunger map A three-fold increase in the proportion of surveyed households reporting poor food consumption has been recorded across Syria since May 2020, reaching 18 percent in September. Between August and September 2020, the national average reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI) increased from 16.8 to 17.7, driven by applying more severe food coping mechanisms by households; almost 48 percent of surveyed households mentioned reducing consumption of adult members to let their children eat, in addition to 66 percent of households reported consumption of less expensive food in September. According to September mVAM data, 61 percent of households with limited access to markets have inadequate food consump- tion, marking more than double the level recorded since April 2020. In September, 46 percent of interviewed households reported not being able to purchase the necessary medicines, with the highest recorded among female-headed households (52 percent), due to lack of financial resources (67 percent) and shortage of medicines in pharmacies (30 percent).",

INTRODUCTION\n\nACTED\u2019 CCCM team conducted a Safety Audit assessment at 50 IDP Camps in Baidoa that ACTED is\n\nimplementing an integrated WASH, shelter, CCCM and Information Management Support in 50 IDP Sites in the four sites/section in Baidoa from 7 June to 10 June, 2020. There are 482 IDP camps in Baidoa\n\naccording to the CCCM sector\u2019s master list. The majority of these IDP camps are overcrowded, self- settled makeshift sites with shelters made of locally available materials such as plastics and worn out clothes. The majority of the displaced population comes from rural villages in Bay and Bakool regions,\n\nthe pushing factors for displacement in these areas are the prolonged drought mixed with diffuse insecurity in South West Regions of Somalia. The provision of basic necessities such as food, water and shelter is essential for sustaining the lives and dignity of IDPs. This safety audit enables humanitarian\n\nactors to identify observable risks and assess specific vulnerabilities of displaced populations living in these settlements. This Safety Audit is the third one conducted by ACTED in Baidoa. Specifically, the assessment was undertaken with the following objectives:\n\nTo observe and evaluate site level protection/GBV risks associated to the camp layout, camp infrastructures and services such WASH, shelter as well as safety and security;\n\nTo understand vulnerabilities that make affected population more expose to GBV risks, particularly women and girls;\n\nTo recommend mitigation measures to be taken collectively by humanitarian actors to reduce the identified risks and/or vulnerabilities identified;\n\nThe findings from the safety audit will be presented and shared with partners, and feedback given will be incorporated in this report as recommendations for possible mitigation actions to be taken by service\n\nproviders in the sites. The CCCM team will regularly follow up on the implementation of recommendations and will monitor the effectiveness of mitigation measures implemented. The report and the annexes will be disseminated among the humanitarian community, local authorities and service\n\nproviders to advocate for measures aiming at improving safety and living conditions in the sites and equal access to services for the affected population.\n\n2. METHODOLOGY\n\nThe Safety Audit assessment was conducted using the Safety Audit Checklist tool for Somalia developed with the support of the GBV integration guidelines team and attached to this report. The checklist was\n\nfilled in through a mix of observations, site walk-throughs, and key informant interviews with female community members. Separate checklists were filled in for every site and results were entered in a data analysis matrix. Data was disaggregated by site and was analyzed to identify GBV risks, vulnerabilities\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nand produce specific recommendations to reduce GBV threats in the sites. In order to complement the checklist tool, 34 women and 16 girls from 50 IDP camps have been involved in one Focus Group\n\nDiscussion (FGD) on 14 and 15 June 2020. The FGD gave the team the opportunity to discuss more in depths GBV risks faced by female residents, concerns related to girls\u2019 education, early marriages and\n\nwomen empowerment as well as ways to overcome the challenges faced by women and girls in the\n\nList of sites assessed in Baidoa, Bay Region\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 3 START] *********\n\nTawakal 2\n\n\n********* [PAGE 3 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 4 START] *********\n\n3. KEY FINDINGS A summary of the main findings by sector, collected through the Safety Audit checklist tool for Somalia. Camp Design and Layout\n\nMost of the of sites are overcrowded and self-settled. Fire risk is high due to the proximity of shelters and inexistent camp layout and design. ACTED CCCM formed and trained 2 fire wardens per sites and distributed fire prevention and control equipment including fire extinguisher and",

    "text": "54871\n\nThe number of patients tested COVID-19 positive continued to increase in the district: from the last week\u2019s 203 to 289 (including seven Rohingya) this week. Out of four parliamentary constituencies in Cox\u2019s Bazar, three Members of the Parliaments (MPs) `have reportedly been infected by the COVID-19. The Daily Inqilab (Bang.) reported that five COVID-infected patients (including three women) died in the district between 1 and 7 April 2021.\n\nSince the nationwide lockdown has been introduced on 5 April, the authorities in Cox\u2019s Bazar have been continuing the enforcement of the requirement for the public to have masks on in public spaces. At the beginning of the week, the mobile courts administered by the district administration fined more than 100 people and 20 shops across the district with BDT 151,100 for not conforming with the COVID-19 health directives. According to the media reports, a stricter week-long lockdown would begin from 14 April across the country.\n\nUnnatural deaths\n\nUnnatural deaths decreased to four this week, from a spike of 13 last week. The number of murders is also down from four to one.\n\nOn 5 April, a 55-year-old man was attacked and killed by his relatives following a land-related dispute in Ramu Upazila. Again, in Ramu on 8 April, a head-on collision between two trucks left a man dead and three others injured. There were two more deaths in Chakaria including a suicide committed by a man and an incident of drowning.\n\nFrom 0.75 million yaba tablets seized last week, the seizure of yaba increased to 1.38 million this week \u2013 four times higher than the weekly average. A total of 25 people were arrested for drug-related offences including six Rohingya from 21 counter narcotics raids [see the table next page].\n\nThe RAB made the largest single seizure of 413,700 tablets in Teknaf Sadar on 4 April. The BGB made the second-largest seizure of 400,000 tablets in Ukhiya on 7 April. Earlier on 5 April, BGB seized 460,000 yaba tablets from three separate drives in Ukhiya and Teknaf. There were also 15 kg of cannabis and 17 cans of beer seized by RAB during the week.\n\nLife of Rohingya\n\nSeveral security incidents in the camps were reported during the week. On 6 April, a Rohingya man\n\nwas arrested by APBn with 145 yaba tablets from Camp-2. Three days later, APBn arrested a Rohingya man with 1,000 yaba tablets from Camp- 24. In the same camp, APBn arrested three Rohingya men allegedly for illegal gambling. Meanwhile, on 7 April, APBn rescued a Rohingya man within a day of his getting kidnapped from Camp 27 (block B).\n\nFollowing repeated fires in the Rohingya camps, DW highlighted the widespread panic of fire among the Rohingya community. Not only in Bangladesh, but there was also report of overnight fire in the Rohingya shelters in Indian- administered Jammu and Kashmir leaving at least two dozen shacks\n\nThis report was prepared by the Cox\u2019s Bazar Analysis and Research Unit (CARU) of the UNDP PTIB Project. Its findings are based on media reports and publicly available material, and do not necessarily reflect the views or analysis of UNDP or of the United Nations.\n\nCARU Weekly Media Monitoring\n\nHost-refugee tensions\n\nOn 4 April, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) rescued a 22-year- old Rohingya woman and her one- year-old daughter (residents of Camp 16, block D/4), who were kidnapped a week back, have been rescued by RAB; a member of the host community has been detained linked to the kidnapping.\n\nOn the other hand, an 18-year-old Bangladeshi youth who was had allegedly been kidnapped by Rohingya miscreants from Camp 13 on 9 March 2021 remains missing. According to Bangladesh Pratidin, the victim's family has already given BDT 0.2 million to the kidnappers however the miscreants are now reportedly demanding a ransom of BDT 2 million.\n\nThere were fresh allegations made by the anti-NGO leaders. In the middle of the week, a prominent anti-NGO leader alleged that the NGO vehicles were failing the district administration to implement the latest lockdown.",

He warned that conditions had deteriorated at an alarming rate since his last visit in October 2017.\n\n6 Months (Jan 2018 \u2013\n\nHe reiterated his call for a cessation of hostilities and urged the parties to the conflict to facilitate humanitarian assistance and protect the supply of food and other essential goods coming into the country.\n\nIn response to the increased fighting in Hodeidah governorate, a Rapid Response Mechanism was established in June to accelerate the humanitarian response for newly displaced persons and to ensure their most basic needs are addressed during their displacement. In particular, WFP is providing displaced families with Immediate Response Rations (IRR) which are sufficient for five days through\n\nHumanitarian Service Points and Humanitarian and Humanitarian Transit Sites. From the start of the large-scale internally displaced persons (IDPs) response in June until November, WFP provided IRRs to 128,975 households.\n\nIn addition to the Immediate Response Rations provided to displaced people fleeing violence from Hodeidah, WFP is also providing a one-off General Food Assistance (GFA) ration, either in-kind or via a commodity voucher to all newly displaced people, sufficient for one month. Thus far, WFP has provided 584,406 people with a one-off GFA ration\u2014252,318 IDPs have received in-kind general food distributions (GFD) and 332,088 have received commodity\n\nvouchers in 14 governorates.\n\nBetween January and November 2018, WFP admitted 430,639 children aged 6 to 59 months and 298,283 pregnant and lactating women (PLW) into WFP\u2019s Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programme (TSFP). For WFP\u2019s\n\nprogramme aimed to prevent moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) called the Blanket Supplementary Feeding Programme (BSFP), WFP admitted 277,833 children aged 6\n\nto 23 months and 379,598 PLW into the programme.\n\nWFP has scaled up its programme for treating moderate acute malnutrition (TSFP) for children under the age of five and PLW. Starting in October, WFP began implementing\n\nTSFP programmes in 3,008 health facilities in 287 districts, an increase of 574 health facilities over the previous 6\n\nmonths. In addition, WFP has created different scenarios to increase BSFP programmes throughout the country based\n\nWFP Yemen Country Brief November 2018\n\non the results of the latest integrated food security phase classification (IPC).\n\nIn the second half of November, operations at Hodeidah port for commercial fuel and food cargo decreased by about 50 percent as shipping\n\ncompanies seem reluctant to deliver to the port due to the ongoing fighting. A decrease in commercial vessels discharging at Hodeidah port could result in food shortages in the market and consequently, increased food prices. Despite the decrease in port operations, WFP discharged one chartered vessel carrying 12,000 mt of lentils at Saleef port on 16 November.\n\nHeavy fighting near the Red Sea Mill silos in\n\nHodeidah continued, leaving the infrastructure that WFP relies on for a quarter of WFP\u2019s wheat at risk. The mills have been inaccessible since September. They are currently storing 51,000 mt of WFP wheat.",

    "text": "55005\n\nFOR THE HUMANITARIAN COMMUNITY\n\nAs the fifth largest country in Africa, Chad stretches for about 1,800 kilometres from its northernmost point to its southern border. The lack of a reliable road network and basic infrastructure is particularly penalising during the rainy season (June to mid-October), when many areas become inaccessible due to heavy rainfall. Moreover, insecurity in several areas renders road travel very hazardous especially in the Lac region. The United Nations Humanitarian Aviation Service (UNHAS), constitutes an essential part of humanitarian operations, providing access to vulnerable populations in the remotest parts of the country.\n\n2020 IN NUMBERS...\n\nMTs OF CARGO\n\nA RELIABLE GATEWAY TO AFFECTED POPULATIONS\n\nUNHAS is a critical enabler of humanitarian and development assistance in Chad. Its network is strategically structured to provide maximum coverage of the large geographical area.\n\nBased on this, UNHAS Chad can quickly reach even the most remote locations in-country as well as fly from Cameroon to the extreme East of Chad and return the same day to Cameroon. Two aircraft are based in the East of the country (Abeche and Goz Beida) close to the Sudanese border, another one is based in the capital (N\u2019Djamena) ensuring connections between the West and the East of the country, and the last one is stationed in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon for timely flights between both countries and the East of Chad.\n\nUNHAS continued to provide critical humanitarian air service in 2020. This included 75 life-saving medical evacuations, of which five were\n\npassengers with Covid-19 to 21 destinations within Chad with a fleet of four fixed wing aircraft.\n\nConsidering the significant reduction in user demand due to the impact of Covid-19, the flight schedule was revised to ensure that partners were supported whilst increasing the operational efficiency and cost effectiveness, ensuring maximised utilization rates including but not limited to enhanced evacuation capabilities and responsiveness.\n\nAt the onset of the Covid-19 global pandemic, resulting in the closure of international airspace, flight schedules were reduced due to an associated significant reduction in user demands. Furthermore, UNHAS Chad-Cameroon flights were suspended on 17 March and resumed on 5 October 2020.\n\nAirfield rehabilitation is an area requiring critical attention since\n\nmost runways were constructed in the 1960s and as the civil aviation authorities only control 3 airfields out of the 21 accessed by UNHAS aircraft in Chad. During the last 12 months, rehabilitations were concluded in five\n\nIn the province of Lac, 26 humanitarian and development organisations expressed the need for a connection to be established between Baga Sola and N\u2019Djamena, to allow a faster access to implementation sites and reduce the risk of insecurity confronted by these workers using road travel. Works were carried out during 2019 and flights started operating in February 2020, three times per week.\n\nThe use of the service split by organizations stands at 45 percent for NGOs, 51 percent for UN Agencies and 4 percent for Government counterparts, diplomatic corps and donor community.\n\nUNHAS ROUTES IN CHAD\n\nAm Djarass\n\nBaga Sola\n\nTo Maroua,\n\nSAFE FLIGHTS UNHAS Chad has fostered a strong partnership with the Civil Aviation Authorities that facilitate granting of flight permits for the operation of aircrafts in the country and in the region (Niger, Cameroon and C.A.R.). Civil Aviation Authorities conduct aviation security trainings to UNHAS personnel and crew members\n\naccessing the airport area. Operational hazard identification and aviation risk management is monitored through the WFP Aviation Safety Programme and the relevant risk analysis and mitigation actions are implemented as required to keep an acceptable level of risk.\n\nDESTINATIONS IN CHAD & 2 REGULAR CONNECTIONS TO\n\nUSER ORGANIZATIONS\n\nUNHAS STAFF (INCLUDING 6\n\nOF FUNDING NEEDS WILL BE GENERATED THROUGH COST RECOVERY (ESTIMATION)",

    "text": "23048\n\nMMC North Africa 4Mi Snapshot Protection risks within and along routes to Libya - A focus on physical abuse\n\nThis snapshot analyses findings from a 4Mi survey of 5,659 refugees and migrants in Libya, conducted\n\nbetween May 2017 and October 2019. Some 70% of respondents originate from countries in West Africa, while 20% are from East Africa and 10% from Central Africa;1 45% are women and 55% are men. The analysis focuses on reports of physical abuse within and along routes to Libya. This snapshot follows a recent snapshot from MMC North Africa on protection incidents, with a focus on sexual abuse.\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of sex and origin country in the 4Mi sample\n\n(N: Female=2,536\n\n1 This snapshot adopts the UNDESA classification of regions, with the exception of Sudan, which is included in East Africa. Regions are defined as follows: East Africa: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda; West Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo; Central Africa: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe.\n\nPhysical abuse is the most common protection\n\nThe recent protection snapshot revealed that 44% of respondents encountered one or more\n\nprotection incidents during their journey. Figure 2 shows the share of respondents experiencing and/ or witnessing different protection incidents, disaggregated by gender. More specifically, it shows that physical abuse is the most prevalent protection incident reported by both men and women, at 22 and 20% respectively. The second most-cited protection incident is robbery (14%) followed by detention, death and sexual abuse, each at 12% for the whole sample.\n\nFigure 2: Protection risks by category and sex\n\nSmugglers are the most frequently cited perpetrators Figure 3 shows the reported perpetrators of physical abuse. Smugglers are most commonly cited\n\nas perpetrators (49%), followed by security personnel (30%). This finding is largely in line with the snapshot on sexual abuse, indicating that perpetrators are often the same, regardless of protection incident. More generally, the data presented here highlight that there are a multitude of perpetrators, including official institutions, fellow migrants, criminal gangs and smugglers.\n\nFigure 3: Perpetrators of physical abuse2\n\nSearch forces/ Single unknown Groups of thugs/ criminal gangs Other migrants/non- related persons Immigration offiicials/ border guards Other authorities\n\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%\n\nThis is further supported by qualitative data collected in the 4Mi survey. Many respondents confirm that smugglers are common perpetrators alongside security forces and border guards. A 32-year-old man from Ghana stated \u201cThere are a lot of human rights violations through the route and both the smuggler and the security border guard are committing offences on a regular basis\u2026\u201d\n\nHe suggested that fellow refugees and migrants who do not have enough money to bribe the security guards and the police are particularly vulnerable:\n\n2 Note that the total sum exceeds 100% as the respondents can choose multiple perpetrators.\n\nExtreme physical abuse, forced labour and torture constitute a large share of reported cases\n\nFigure 4 details the nature of the reported cases of abuse. Overall, the data indicate that many of\n\nthe reported incidents are serious human rights violations. The most commonly reported incident is mild physical abuse (64%), defined as incidents of slapping, beating and whipping. Some 16% of respondents report being denied food or water, and 13% cite experiencing forced labour. As many as 9% of all cases of abuse constitute \u201cextreme physical abuse\u201d, which includes burning, gunshots and torture.\n\nFigure 4: Nature of abuse3\n\nMild physical abuse Denied food or water Forced labour Deprivation of sleep physical abuse Stone throwing\n\n10% 20%\n\nA 20 year-old man from Nigeria explains how he was beaten and forced to work to settle the smuggler fee:",

    "text": "53312\n\nReporting as of 2 April 2021\n\nPrevious reports can be accessed here.\n\nUNHCR\u2019s partner OXFAM provides clean water for families affected by the fire. \u00a9 UNHCR/2021\n\nFollowing the devastating fire that broke out in Kutupalong Balukhali refugee camps on 22 March, UNHCR has been responding to the immediate needs of the affected population under the leadership of the Government of Bangladesh and the Inter-Sector Coordination Group (ISCG), working closely with IOM and other partner UN agencies, and NGOs. According to findings from the ISCG Rapid Joint Needs Assessment, 48,300 individuals lost their shelters when the fire spread through Camp 8W, 8E, and 9. The fire impacted 92,000* individuals, and destroyed over 1,600 facilities including hospitals, distribution points, learning centres, and a UNHCR registration centre.\n\nUNHCR has identified immediate needs amounting to US$5.9 million to address the immediate aftermath of fire. To date, UNHCR is only 20 per cent funded, of the USD$294.5 million it is seeking for the overall Rohingya refugee response in Bangladesh in 2021. Additional support is urgently needed. For more details, click here.\n\n*Population residing around the fire affected area within a 100m buffer zone whose shelters were destroyed to create fire breaks and/or were accessing services and facilities in camps 8E, 8W and 9.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TO FIRE\n\n\u2022 From 31 March, UNHCR deployed its registration teams to key WFP distribution points in fire affected camps to re-issue refugee identity documentation that was destroyed in the fire. UNHCR and WFP are working together closely, utilizing community outreach mechanisms, to ensure refugees in affected camps as well as those who are sheltering in neighbouring camps are referred for new documentation. As of 1 April, 442 households have received family attestation documentation, which includes some 2,000 refugees.\n\nOver 300 UNHCR-supported refugee volunteers continue to actively support refugees in the fire affected camps as well as in other camps where refugees are taking shelter. For example, by taking older refugees, children and pregnant women to safe places, accompanying affected refugees to health care facilities, assisting in building temporary shelters, and clearing debris, and identifying and referring refugees with specific needs to relevant service providers. They are also conducting awareness raising sessions on child protection risks such as child-trafficking and gender-based violence (GBV), fire safety and general assistance.\n\nUNHCR\u2019s partners CODEC, Relief International, Save the Children International and Terre des Hommes identified more than 600 separated children. All have now been reunited with their families. Two child protection helplines and 4 re-unification help desks were established by UNHCR\u2019s partner Relief International.\n\nCoordinated messages on services and support available are being shared through partners, refugee volunteers and refugee leaders covering health, child protection, GBV, and registration. UNHCR\u2019s Interactive Voice Response (IVR) has started broadcasting calls with recorded messages. More than 5,000 refugees have been contacted so far, while efforts continue to reach out to more affected\n\nSite Management, Shelter and Non-Food Items (NFI)\n\nAs of 1 April, 1,705 families totaling 8,190 individuals from the affected camps temporally moved to and remain sheltered in UNHCR-managed camps. The remaining estimated 40,000 displaced refugees are in IOM-managed camps in temporary shelter.\n\nWhile considering that families are eager to rebuild their shelters, and the monsoon season is approaching, in coordination with IOM and the ISCG, UNHCR is supporting initiatives to rebuild the destroyed shelters in a safer way. This includes advocating with the authorities for rebuilding to include site improvements such as fire breaks to reduce the risk of fires spreading.\n\nSo far, UNHCR handed over 3,000 blankets, 20,000 solar lamps, 7,000 kitchen sets, 7,000 stoves and 7,000 mosquito nets to IOM for distribution. UNHCR has so far provided 3,200 female hygiene kits through various partners.",

This is likely to worsen the food security outlook through early 2021. An estimated 3.5 million people are projected to be severely food insecure (IPC 3 \u2018Crisis\u2019 and\n\nabove) between July-September. Sustained large-scale humanitarian assistance to prevent further destitution and to protect the gains already made in enhancing access to food is required.\n\nWFP Somalia continued to save lives through food and cash-based transfer (CBT) assistance, reaching 1.64 million\n\nwomen, men and children in the communities most affected by acute food and nutrition insecurity. Of these people, approximately 650,400 received CBTs equivalent to US$ 8.3 million. Preventative and curative nutrition assistance\n\nreached 584,000 pregnant and nursing women, and children aged 6-59 months. Another 18,018 people received cash vouchers in Dolow through the food assistance for assets programme. This enabled them to access food while rehabilitating and creating productive assets such as growing nutritious fruits and vegetables for family use.\n\nIn April and May, WFP trained mothers and caregivers on the family Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC). The training equipped them with skills and knowledge on the\n\nuse of MUAC, placing them at the center of screening to detect the earliest signs of malnutrition in children. By the end of August, 82 percent of WFP\u2019s cooperating partners had transitioned from community health workers-led MUAC screening to mother-led MUAC screening. This has resulted in mothers being at the forefront in promoting the health of their children. This has also limited any unintended infections during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAfter nearly six months of COVID-19-related school closures in Somalia, the Government reopened schools starting 15\n\nAugust. Before the closures, WFP provided hot meals (breakfast and lunch) to 165,000 school going children under the WFP school feeding programme (SFP). These meals enabled the children to meet their food and nutrition needs and contributed to improved school enrolment and attendance for better education achievements. During the new academic year (2020/21), WFP has been forced to scale down its school feeding programme due to a funding\n\nshortfall, only retaining 62 percent of the previous coverage.\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\n\u2022 Provision of unconditional food and/or cash-based food assistance, specialized nutritious foods and gender-transformative nutrition messaging and counselling to crisis-affected people through well-coordinated food security and logistics during humanitarian responses.\n\n\u2022 Provision of conditional and unconditional food and/or cash-based food assistance and nutritional messaging to food-insecure people through reliable safety nets, including school meals. \u2022 Provision of unconditional cash transfers in rural areas to targeted poor and vulnerable households\n\n\u2022 Provision of specialized nutritious foods and nutrition messaging to children, adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and girls (PLWG) and ART/TB-DOT clients to systematically treat and prevent malnutrition and to stimulate positive behaviour change.\n\n\u2022 Provision of services, skills, assets and infrastructure for the rehabilitation and strengthening of food supply chains.\n\n\u2022 Provision of technical support for the strengthening of national policies, capacities and systems.",

Almost 13 million people have had to flee their\n\nhomes, 1.5 million more than one year ago. Insecurity and violence are threatening lives and livelihoods, increasing human rights violations, including sexual and gender-based violence, and jeopardizing social cohesion.

As a result, in 2021 across the region, more than 40 million people are facing severe food insecurity.

Sahel countries have registered nearly 300,000 cases of COVID-19. The delivery of humanitarian assistance continued with adapted delivery modalities accompanied by sensitization measures. In Burkina Faso, Chad, and Nigeria, COVID-19 mitigation measures have had a negative impact on access to agricultural inputs and labour. The COVID crisis, on top of the escalation of conflict, forced displacements, and natural disasters, has exacerbated pre-existing gender inequalities and significantly worsened protection of women and girls in the\n\nANALYSIS (19 Jul 2021) Funding Status for West and Central Africa\n\nCERF and CBPF Between the year 2020 and the first half of 2021,\u00a0both UN pooled funds \u2013 the\u00a0Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)\u00a0and the Country Based Pooled Funds (CBPFs) - provided over $335 million in support of the humanitarian response in West and Central Africa\u00a0covering eight countries, including Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mali, Niger, and Nigeria.\n\nThe CERF was granted around $202.4million, of which 64 percent ($130.5 million) came from the Rapid Response window; while 36 per cent ($71.9 million) were issued from the underfunded window. While almost all the region's countries benefited from the CERF Rapid Response in 2020, only Burkina Faso, DRC, Niger, Chad, and Nigeria received funding from the CERF UFE in 2020.

The Naval Base continues to be the largest disembarkation point with 2,783 refugees and migrants disembarked in 2018. UNHCR and its partner International Medical Corps (IMC) have been present at all disembarkations in Tripoli since the beginning of the year providing medical assistance and humanitarian support to disembarked refugees and migrants. So far, in 2018 they have provided individuals with 2,270 sets of non-food items and 277 medical consultations. UNHCR Response\n\nIn coordination with authorities and partners, UNHCR will respond to the humanitarian needs of over 1,500 internally displaced families in Sabha, Ubari, and Murzuq. Over the last few weeks, clashes between armed groups in the southern region have forced hundreds of families to move to safer areas in Sabha (850 families), Ubari (307 families) and Murzuq (413 families). Families have been sheltered in public schools in Sabha, others have been hosted by communities and relatives in Ubari and Murzuq. Last week, UNHCR and its partner LibAid conducted a rapid needs assessment in the region. The most pressing needs are related to shelter and health. In the next days, UNHCR and its partner LibAid are planning a distribution of kitchen sets, sleeping mats, hygiene kits and other non-food items to cover the most immediate material needs of those displaced in the area.\n\nIn order to respond to the growing needs of women displaced across Libya, UNHCR and UNFPA, with the support of German funding, are distributing 8,517 hygiene kits in 16 different locations in Tripoli, Misrata, Sabha, Nafusa Mountains, Bani Walid, Janzour, Ubari and Murzaq. This week\u2019s distribution of hygiene and sanitary items reached 900 women from Tawergha living in three IDP settlements in and around Tripoli.\n\nUNHCR and its partners, IMC and CESVI, conducted eight focus group discussions with refugees living in urban settings in Tripoli.

They rely on food assistance to survive as conflict persists, the economy is in crisis, and agricultural production \u2012 the only income-generating sector left \u2014 is being\n\nfurther limited by COVID-19 measures.\n\nThe threat of a COVID-19 outbreak is aggravating the economic downturn and constraining humanitarian response further \u2013 a situation that could have severe impacts in NWS as well as across the whole region.\n\nFood insecurity in NWS has become even more critical over the last months, due to the large- scale displacement of about 1M people who left villages affected by the conflict. Furthermore, local economies are in downturn as food prices skyrocket while the purchasing power of the most vulnerable households is being sharply eroded.\n\nThe increased number of people in need in NWS is compounded by the reduced number of border crossings for humanitarian assistance, which have been reduced to a single point in Idlib\n\nRelying on a single-entry point for all partners is expected to lead to delayed shipments \u2013 the majority of which are food \u2013 as well as higher costs and more complex logistics. Agricultural production inputs supply to NWS is less affected as it does not require frequent repeated shipments.\n\nPoor road conditions to northern Aleppo and Afrin will be deteriorate more due to the extra trucks now using them, hampering operations further.\n\nAs such, it is vital to sustain funding and use every means available to ensure the timely and planned delivery of lifesaving assistance,\n\nespecially given the added COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nWith some 60 active implementing partners, the gFSC supports food & livelihoods response in NWS through the FSL Cluster South Turkey hub by:\n\nPROVIDING KEY\n\n\n\nDRIVERS OF FOOD INSECURITY\n\nSyria: a country in its tenth year of conflict facing the threat of a pandemic\n\nWith the economic crisis, mass displacement and high unemployment, COVID-19 is also rolling back development and putting unbearable pressure on host communities.\n\nEconomic crisis: twin-tracks of sharp currency depreciation and high inflation\n\nPrices of food, medicine, and fuel have reached unprecedented levels, with the Syrian Pound (SYP) depreciating by at least 325 percent over the past one year. The national average reference food basket price has recorded a 261 percent increase year-on-year as of July 2020 with the highest spike recorded in Idlib at 464\n\nLow agricultural production eroding incomes and assets\n\nMilitary escalation led to loss of farming and cropping land, which limited crop production, and further increased input prices. Only 58 percent of the population\u2019s minimum bread needs are being met. While animal production in NWS still provides dairy products, eggs, and meat, it is under constant threat from uncontrolled livestock epidemics (such as the Lumpy Skin Disease outbreak in 2019 and 2020).\n\nCOVID-19 and its health, economic and food security impacts\n\nAs a result of COVID-19, access to markets is being reduced, driving up food prices and hitting people\u2019s incomes. 40 cases have been reported in over-crowded areas of NWS, with the risk of a rapid further spread.\n\nFSL Cluster ST Hub\n\ngFSC calls urgently for:\n\nScaled up emergency food\n\nSafeguard food access, availability and utilization.

    "text": "55122\n\nNIGERIA Food Security Outlook Update April 2021 Assistance needs in the Northeast are elevated due to increasing conflict and large-scale displacement\n\nKEY MESSAGES\n\nProjected food security outcomes, April to May 2021\n\nIncreasing of already high levels of conflict in the Northeast is limiting humanitarian activities, agricultural labor activities, as well as the ongoing dry season harvest and household purchasing power. This is driving an increase in the population facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes. Most hard-to-reach areas of Borno State continue to rely on foraging as they have little or no food stocks with limited market access. These areas are expected to remain in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). During the lean season, Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are expected to emerge due to limited ability to engage in typical livelihood activities as populations have been displaced multiple times and access constraints will limit food assistance. A risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) persists in a worst-case scenario if households are cut off from their typical food and income sources and humanitarian assistance for a prolonged period of time.\n\nSource: FEWS NET Projected food security outcomes, June to September 2021\n\nPersistent and recent attacks in Damasak, Dikwa, and Marte LGAs in Borno State have led to over 60,000 people displaced to safer areas, mainly to Maiduguri, based on available information from REACH and IOM. Similar attacks on Geidam LGA in Yobe state led to the displacement of several thousand residents towards neighboring Yusufari, Yunusari, and Damaturu LGAs in Yobe state. Many displaced households face difficulty engaging in typical livelihood activities in the areas where they are displaced to and rely heavily on limited humanitarian assistance. Consequently, many displaced populations are experiencing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes, while the worst affected are facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4). Source: FEWS NET In the Northwest, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes continue and FEWS NET classification is IPC-compatible. IPC-compatible analysis follows are expected to persist in the worst conflict-affected areas, key IPC protocols but does not necessarily reflect the consensus of national food security partners. particularly among displaced households due to limited livelihood activities and dry season food production. Most conflict-affected households continue to rely mainly on the market for food, where rising food prices constrain access. While some households are consuming own foods and market-dependent households are accessing food normally. Many others are selling livestock to earn income and access food typically, though unable to meet their non-food needs, and are in Stressed (IPC Phase 2).\n\nThe macroeconomic conditions remain poor, largely due to declining foreign reserves. The annual inflation rate continues to increase for the 19th straight month to 18.17 percent in March, with monthly food inflation hitting a nearly 16-year high at 22.95 percent. Similarly, the value of the Naira continues to depreciate relative to other foreign currencies leading to further pressure on already stressed markets. This, coupled with high demand, reduces household purchasing power as unemployment rates continue their upward trend.\n\nFEWS NET Nigeria\n\nFEWS NET is a USAID-funded activity.

Inflation rate for all items (January 2016 to March Despite the end of the recession in the last quarter of 2020, macroeconomic conditions remain poor primarily due to low foreign reserves and government revenue from crude oil. The annual inflation rate increased for the 19th straight month to 18.17 percent in March (Figure 1), with monthly food inflation hitting nearly 16-year peak at 22.95 percent. The Naira continues to depreciate relative to other foreign currencies. The Naira depreciated by about 17 and 28 percent on the formal and parallel market, respectively, between March 2020 and March 2021. Staple food prices across all monitored markets remain significantly above last year and the five-year average for all commodities. In March, maize prices are over 100 percent Source: FEWS NET/NBS higher relative to the same time last year in Dawanau market in Kano state. While market stocks slightly increased following the start of the dry season harvest in April, market demand remains high mainly due to the below-average 2020/21 harvest and high levels of conflict driving higher market reliance and disruption to trade flows. Also, the high transportation costs due to high petrol price, which is 166 NGN/liter in February, also impact staple food prices.",

This meeting was extended to Provincial Governors of affected provinces, Humanitarian Country Team and National directors of different sectors.\n\nIn the CCGC meeting the National Institute of Meteorology (INAM) informed that in the next 14 days it is foreseen weak to moderate and locally heavy rainfall in several areas of the country mainly in Sofala, Zamb\u00e9zia and Manica where the rainfall will be between 200-300 mm due to Tropical cyclone IDAI. The cyclone will approach the Mozambique channel and will landfall through Sofala province with Intense Tropical Cyclone category most likely on 15 March 2019. The speed wind will be between 188-220 km/h and rainfall above 150 mm in 24h.\n\nMoreover, the Water resources authorities indicated that due to flood wave caused by heavy rains in the upstream part of the Zambeze region it is expected water levels of 8m in Caia and Marromeu districts in Sofala province resulting in flooding in the area. The authorities prepared three flood scenarios depending on the rainfall and discharge to be recorded which the population at risk varies from 85,000 to 221,000 people in the Zambezi basin.\n\nTherefore, in the next 3 days it is expected the rise of water level that may overcome the alert level in the Licungo, Zambeze, Pungoe and Buzi river basins. The operation status of the defense dykes in these basins is very bad which makes the area more vulnerable. It is also foreseen moderate to high urban flooding in Quelimane, Beira and Dondo where about 13,000 people are at risk. Based on the forecast, the Pungoe river basin might reach the peak of 5,000 m3/s causing floods in the districts of Nhamatanda, Muanza and Dondo where an estimated 25,250 people are at risk. The authorities also expect damages in at least eleven road sections in these four river basins.\n\nUnited Nations Office of the Resident Coordinator\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nFlooding No. 4 | 2\n\nGiven the current and expected situation after the floods and cyclone, the National Institute of Disaster Management estimated a total funding requirement of about US$ 18 million for food and non-food items that might be needed for the potential affected people. This funding estimate does not include the funds needed for emergency road work (estimated at US$ 13.9 million) to reset the road network which is 31% damaged in Zamb\u00e9zia and 50% damaged in Cabo Delgado.\n\nAs the situation is complex and resources are limited, the Government activated the Institutional Red alert (the maximum alert level for emergency response in the country) to enable operation at full capacity, mobilize additional resources, compulsory withdrawal of population at risk among other activities.\n\nImpact and Response\n\nAccording to Zambezia provincial authorities, 48,045 people are affected by floods, 5,438 houses were totally destroyed and 201 classrooms affected. There are in Zamb\u00e9zia, 13,125 people displaced and hosted in 12 accommodation centers in five districts namely Maganja da Costa, Nicoadala, Molumbo, Namacurra and Morrumbala. In the agriculture sector, about 78,621ha of crop area is flooded affecting 52,210 smallholder farmers and the estimated needs in terms of seeds (rice and maize) vary from 3.8 \u2013 60 ton. The Education sector estimated the needs in terms of learner kits (25,042), school tents (8) and teacher kits (607).",

A marked increase in precision airstrikes has been reported over the past few days in Abu Salim, Wadi al-Rabie, al-Swani, Ain Zara and in the vicinity of Tripoli International Airport. As a direct result of armed conflict, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate. On the ground, frontlines have largely remained static and the number of ground engagements and intensity of rocket/mortar attacks has reduced from previous days.\n\n\uf0b7 At least 89 civilian casualties, including 20 fatalities, have been verified since the beginning of the conflict, with no new casualty figures verified in the past 48 hours.1 These casualties include medical personnel, women and children, and at least one refugee/migrant.\n\n\uf0b7 Refugees and migrants in urban settings report to face discrimination with regards to their to access collective shelters, with reports of them being routinely requested to provide health certificates as a pretext for denying them access to collective shelters. In response, a dedicated collective shelter under the supervision of the Libyan Red Cross has been set up in a school building in downtown Tripoli to receive exclusively refugees and migrants. Humanitarian partners continue to advocate for the rights of refugees and migrants regarding their safe and unimpeded access to shelter space and access other life-saving assistance.\n\n\uf0b7 Nearly 3,600 refugees and migrants remain trapped in detention centres (DCs) that are in conflict-affected areas or in areas at risk of armed conflict. Beyond the threat posed by ongoing fighting, refugees and migrants in the Qasr Bin Ghasheer, Abusliem, Triq al Sika, Al Sabaa, Tajoura, Janzour and Gharyan DCs face dire living conditions, with the lack of food being of particular concern. A solution to the breakdown in food provision at DCs has yet to be found, since the companies contracted by local authorities to provide food to the affected DCs have ceased deliveries due to the security situation. On 21 April, a local partner overcame roadblocks and checkpoints to deliver a supply of dry rations to the Qasr Bin Ghasheer DC, as an interim measure only intended to last for three days prior to running out. In the Gahryan DC the WASH situation is extremely poor and, according to IOM and UNHCR, the site has been without drinking water for several days. Further reports were received that armed forces are currently located inside the Gharyan DC, increasing the protection concerns faced by the civilians detained there. On 21 April, a mother gave birth in Qasr Bin Ghasheer DC without medical assistance, as ambulances reportedly are refusing to attend to medical cases in the DC. On 22 April the mother and infant were transferred to a private clinic.",

    "text": "47683\n\nHEALTH SITUATION\n\nCOVID-19 update As of 30 September, there have been 1,203 confirmed cases and 85 deaths in 17 provinces. Between 27 and 30\n\nSeptember, there have been 23 new cases, all reported in the capital or in southern provinces: 13 in the Mayo- Kebbi ouest, six in the Logone occidental, three in the Logone oriental, and five in N\u2019Djamena. Reported cases are still contact cases and travelers (incoming and prospective). This is the seventh consecutive week with over 20 new reported cases, which denotes a steady presence of the pandemic although no major flare-up. To put this into perspective, the peak of the epidemic in Chad reached 205 new cases in one week back in June\n\nChikungunya update\n\nAs of 26 September, there have been 31,374 reported cases and one death. After a spike in contaminations in early September, with an average of 1,000 new reported cases every day, the epidemic seems to have slowed down over the past week with 561 new cases reported for 26 September. The district of Abeche remains the most affected with 26,823 reported cases since 14 August.\n\nLac province 12 hostages freed by the Chadian army during military operations: Nine children and three women, taken hostage by a non-state armed group (NSAG) on 15 September in Kinasserom, near Cameroon, were liberated by the Chadian army on 24 September during military operations in Barkaram, not far from the Nigerian border. Another attack in Bilabrim (Niger) where an FDP military outpost is located also took place on the same day following an incursion by NSAG elements. During the two clashes, a total of 20 NSAG combatants were neutralized and two Chadian soldiers were wounded. The women and children have been taken to a transit\n\ncenter for medical attention, while awaiting their return home. NSAG attacks are becoming more and more frequent in the Lac province, as well as in neighboring countries (Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria). The NSAG trend of kidnapping civilians after looting and pillages has been on the rise recently. It is a recurrent protection problem in the Lac Province, accounting for 40 percent of all protection incidents in August against an average of 5 percent in June and July.\n\nHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE\n\nA total of 129 people deported from Libya over five days: On 23 and 28 September, two waves of 38 and 91 Chadians respectively arrived in the town of Ounianga Kebir, located near the Libyan border. Upon arrival, these individuals were placed in quarantine, in accordance with measures taken by the Chadian authorities to prevent and contain the spread of COVID-19. Such deportations - the majority from north-east Libya - have been reported since mid-April 2020. For the month of September alone, 155 cases were reported. These people arrive in a state of extreme vulnerability with priority needs in food, water and NFIs. IOM provides them with food,\n\nshelter and NFIs and helps them go back to their original area after quarantine.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nOCHA operational updates | 2\n\nFloods update An estimated 388,000 people are flood-affected in the country: In total, 19 provinces out of 23 are affected by\n\nfloods in the country. Compared to the previous assessment from last week, and following a joint review of all figures by the Crisis Committee to incorporate new information from the provinces, an additional 113,000 people are believed affected: updated figures show an increase in the number of flood-affected households in the central and eastern provinces (from 16,000 to over 26,000), and in southern provinces (from 17,000 to over 26,000). Conversely, figures had been overestimated in the Lac (they are now down from 7,000 to 3,780 affected households). In N\u2019Djamena, the situation remains stationary with 5,812 households affected by recent floods. As of 30 September, humanitarian partners have provided initial support in food and NFIs to 2,648 households",

    "text": "44855\n\nFuel crisis\n\nFaced with a shortage on fuel, on 12 September 2020, the Syrian govern- ment reduced vehicle owners\u2019 petrol allocation from 40 litres to 30 litres per vehicle every four days while maintaining the subsidized 100 litres per vehicle per month allocation. Additionally, the Syrian government also reduced the allocated purchase of non-subsidized fuel from 400 litres per month to 100 litres per month.\n\nThe reduction in the fuel allocation is led primarily by the lack of hard currency, the depreciation of the Syrian pound in the informal exchange rate market and the continued imposition of unilateral coercive measures on Syria, which make it harder for Syria to import fuel. Additionally, the Banias oil refinery which covers a significant part of Syria\u2019s demand for diesel, fuel for heating, petrol and other petroleum products, was under maintenance leading to further shortage of fuel2.\n\nInformal diesel prices\n\nIn September 2020, the informal national average price of diesel in- creased by 23 percent since August 2020, reaching SYP 592/litre. Moreo- ver, the informal price remains higher than the formal price (SYP 174/ litre) by 240 percent (Chart 10). Idleb continued to report the highest informal price at SYP 1,271/litre (up four percent m-o-m), followed by Aleppo at SYP 1,025/litre (up 20 percent m-o-m). The lowest average informal price was reported in Al-Hasakeh at SYP 150/litre (unchanged m-\n\no-m), followed by Ar-Raqqa at SYP 244/litre (unchanged m-o-m).\n\nBroken down by regions, the southern region recorded the highest m-o-m increase of 32 percent, reaching SYP 547/litre, followed by the middle region with an increase of 22 percent m-o-m reaching SYP 488/litre. On the other hand, the cross-border region recorded the lowest m-o-m in- crease in price, by six percent reaching SYP 1,264/litre, followed by the coastal region with an increase of 13 percent m-o-m reaching SYP 445/\n\nWeek-on-week, the national average diesel price jumped by ten percent between the last week of August and first week of September. By the second week of September, the national average price remained un- changed at SYP 538/litre. The national average price then increased by\n\nsix, 13 and three percent between the third, fourth and fifth weeks of\n\nSeptember, respectively, reaching SYP 668/litre by the fifth week of Sep- tember. The average diesel price in September was SYP 592/litre.\n\nFood-items prices\n\nThe increase in the informal price of diesel was one of the main factors that caused prices of fruits, vegetables and other food items to increase between August and September 2020. Other reasons related to extensive fires in early September in coastal areas of Syria where fruits and vegeta- bles are cultivated/imported.\n\nBetween August and September, the national average price of bananas increased by 13 percent reaching SYP 4,095/kg; the national average price of tomatoes increased by 30 percent to reach SYP 419/kg; and the nation- al average price of potatoes increased by 25 percent reaching SYP 397/kg.\n\nMoreover, the national average price of eggs increased by nine percent m -o-m reaching SYP 4,031/30 eggs; and the national average price of white cheese also increased by nine percent, reaching SYP 3,920/kg.\n\nChart 2: Formal and informal diesel prices, SYP* Bakery in Aleppo @ Hussam Al Saleh Chart 3: Informal diesel price evolution week-on-week in September, SYP Chart 4: Food-items price evolution Source: WFP Field Offices\n\nStaple cereals retail prices\n\nWheat Flour M-o-m, the national average retail price of wheat flour through- out Syria increased in September 2020 by four percent reaching SYP 1,059/kg. The wheat flour price was 281 percent higher y-o- y. Al-Hasakeh continued to record the highest wheat flour price (unchanged m-o-m) reaching SYP 1,283/kg, followed by Tartous (unchanged m-o-m) reaching SYP 1,135/kg. The lowest average wheat flour price was recorded in Idleb at SYP 911/kg (down two\n\npercent m-o-m), followed by Aleppo at SYP 981/kg (up 13 per- cent m-o-m).",

    "text": "49528\n\nUp to 2.7 million people in Somalia face acute food insecurity Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes through mid-\n\nApproximately 839 000 children likely to be acutely malnourished\n\nFebruary 4, 2021, Mogadishu/Washington \u2013 Up to 2.7 million people across Somalia are expected to face food consumption gaps or depletion of livelihood assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3)1 or worse outcomes through mid-2021 in the absence of humanitarian assistance. The drivers of acute food insecurity in Somalia include the compounding effects of poor and erratic rainfall distribution, flooding, Desert Locust infestation, socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19, and conflict. Moreover, approximately 840 000 children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished, including nearly 143 000 who are likely to be severely malnourished. It is likely that sustained, large-scale humanitarian food assistance and government support since July 2020 have mitigated the magnitude and severity of food insecurity. Through at least mid-2021, Desert Locust will continue to pose a serious risk of damage to both pasture and crops across Somalia. Available forecasts indicate an increased likelihood of below-average rainfall during the 2021 Gu (April-June) season across most of the country, which would adversely affect food security and nutrition outcomes. These findings are based on the 2020 post-Deyr seasonal food security and nutrition assessment conducted across Somalia in November and December 2020. The assessment and the subsequent analyses were jointly led by the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU, a project managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET, a project funded by USAID) with the active participation of government institutions, UN, and NGO partners.\n\nDelayed and erratic rainfall distribution characterized the October to December 2020 Deyr season, resulting in below-average, cumulative rainfall across most of the country. The poor rains led to inadequate replenishment of pasture and water resources and\n\nbelow-average Deyr crop production. In addition, Cyclone Gati caused significant damages and livestock deaths in northeastern coastal areas in late November, though the rains ultimately alleviated dry conditions. Furthermore, recurrent floods between July and early November caused further population displacement and damaged crops and farmland in riverine areas of Hiiraan, Shabelle, and Juba regions. Despite favorable Hagaa/Karan (July-September) rainfall in agropastoral and pastoral livelihood zones in the Northwest, the rains could not compensate for crop losses caused by poor Gu (April-June 2020) rainfall during the planting, germination, and growing\n\n2020 Deyr season cereal production in southern Somalia is estimated at 78 600 tons, which is 20 percent below the 1995-2019 average.\n\nThe main factors for below-average production include: poor and erratic rainfall, recurrent flooding, Desert Locust, and conflict. In the Northwest, 2020 Gu/Karan cereal production harvested in November 2020 is estimated at 17 100 tons, which is 58 percent below the 2010-2019 average, mainly due to poor and erratic rainfall and Desert Locust and stalk borer infestations on both sorghum and maize.\n\nRural populations are experiencing multiple declines in food and income sources. In pastoral areas, below-average rainfall in parts of the North, adjacent areas of central Somalia, coastal areas, and Gedo region has led to water scarcity and pasture shortages, prompting atypical, earlier-than-normal livestock migration to distant grazing areas. As a result, milk availability for consumption and sale is limited. Additionally, a sharp decline in livestock exports since August 2020 has adversely affected pastoralists and other households who work in the livestock value chain. In many pastoral livelihood zones, poor households with limited saleable animals will face moderate to large food consumption gaps through mid-2021. In agropastoral livelihood zones, where the main shocks include erratic and poorly distributed rainfall, Desert Locust and stalk borer infestations, and conflict, poor households have experienced crop losses and low income from agricultural employment. With few alternative food and income sources, they face moderate to large food consumption gaps through mid-2021. In riverine livelihood zones along the Shabelle and Juba rivers, recurrent floods destroyed farmland and crops",

Call for volunteers (repurposed or new hire) made to address the need for additional medical staff for high transmission phase of COVID-19 Seven regular camp level coordination meetings facilitated by camp health focal points (CHFPs) were held in the past one week with the focus on COVID-19 response. Health Sector Inter-agency team led by Ministry of health Coordination cell and RRRC Health Unit conducted quality assurance supportive supervision visit as Camp 26. Team interacted with health facility staff and communities in camp to support health facilities increasing community confidence to health facilities in context of current COVID-19 situation. Health sector coordinated three online awareness sessions for health partners in collaboration with ISCG Gender hub, PSEA network and GBV Sub-Sector. Participation in each of the sessions by health sector partners was as follows: Gender; 34 participants, PSEA; 46 participants and GBV; 36 participants. Two more Inter-agency quality assurance supportive sessions are planned for health partners in the coming week on supervision in Camp 26 protection and child protection.\n\nRISK COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT: \u2022 WHO continues to engage with community staff and responders working with national health authorities, and other partners, to develop, implement and monitor an effective action plan for communicating effectively with the public, engaging with communities, local partners and other stakeholders to help prepare and protect individuals, families and the public\u2019s health during the early response to COVID-19\n\nSituation Report #104\n\nMessages have been developed on COVID-19 in general, risks and vulnerabilities, safe and dignified burials, home based care, isolation and quarantine, isolation and treatment centers and other issues. WHO has provided technical input to responses to rumors and community feedback through Communication with\n\nCommunity (CWC) mechanisms\n\nWHO is supporting translation of essential technical materials into local language to improve uptake of messages and support behavioral impact\n\nBetween 02 and 08 July 2020 through CwC partners, 150,777 people in the FDMN/Rohingya camps were reached with COVID-19 messages through 49,421 neighborhood-based sessions; 22,713 people were consulted on COVID-19 key messages through 12,895 community meetings; 1,491 listener group sessions were organized for 7,961 people; and 389 video/film show sessions held on COVID-19.",

    "text": "6932\n\nThis report is produced by OCHA in collaboration with humanitarian partners. It is issued by the OCHA Yemen office. The next report will be issued when additional information on the emergency becomes available.\n\nDuring the reporting period, humanitarian partners continued to pre-position life-saving supplies in Al Hudaydah City where a reduction in hostilities since 12 November provided a much-needed respite to the population.\n\nConflict however did not completely stop; sporadic fighting, shelling and bombardment continued to pose a threat to civilians in Al Hudaydah City and in other parts of the governorate. In Al Hudaydah City, clashes persisted in the east and northeast of the city, particularly around Al Saleh Residential Complex near 50 Street and Kilo 16.\n\nA Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) distribution in Abs, Hajjah, coordinated by NRC. \u00a9UNFPA Yemen\n\nMilitary activities continued in the coastal districts of Ad Durayhimi, At Tuhayat and Bayt Al Faqiah as well as in Hays District. Airstrikes and shelling hit main roads in At Tuhayat and Zabid districts several times. The Protection Cluster estimates that there were up to 1,460 civilian casualties in November and that fighting damaged 200 homes, and an unspecified number farms and humanitarian sites.\n\nAs part of the Al Hudaydah Response Plan, partners have pre-positioned 15,000 hygiene and transit kits and 8,000 immediate response rations kits in\n\nwarehouses in the three districts of Al Hudaydah City. They have also pre-positioned 3,750 non-food item (NFI) packages, 500 emergency shelter kits, 1,000 tents and 40,000 food baskets. An additional 15,000 hygiene kits have been pre-positioned in warehouses belonging to the city\u2019s local water and sanitation corporation.\n\nBetween 13 and 26 November, Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) partners registered 4,700 displaced families. Overall, partners working across the Al Hudaydah hub area have identified 133,916 displaced families from Al Hudaydah Governorate since June 2018. Of the displaced families, 130,879 have received RRM assistance. The conflict continues to affect humanitarian operations. WFP reports that for the past two months, fighting has prevented its staff from providing food assistance to almost 250,000 people in two conflict-affected districts of Ad Durayhimi District.\n\nThe Red Sea Mills have been inaccessible since September, reducing WFP\u2019s milling capacity by 20 per cent across the country; the mills store 51,000 metric tonnes (MT) of wheat, enough to feed 3.7 million people for a month. Despite the situation, WFP continues to do everything it can to deliver assistance across Al Hudaydah Governorate. In October, it provided general food assistance to over 300,000 people in the governorate, including over 66,000 people in Al Hudaydah City.\n\nRRM Response as of 29 November 2018\n\nSource: UNFPA RRM mechanism\n\nCurrency value\n\nThe value of the Yemeni Rial in Al Hudaydah City increased significantly during the reporting period, with exchange rates reaching 390YER/USD, up from 665YER/US$. No major changes in the price of basic food commodities were observed in local markets. Fuel prices reduced slightly with one litre of petrol selling at 500YER, down from 575YER.\n\nSea ports\n\nAl Hudaydah and Saleef sea ports continued to operate but the number of vessels berthing at the ports over recent weeks has declined. According to WFP, operations at Al Hudaydah port have decreased by 47 per cent in the two weeks to 20 November. In addition, as a result of ongoing fighting, fewer port staff are reporting for work for safety and security reasons, further decreasing the capacity of the port.\n\nTo help the displaced through the winter, the Yemen Humanitarian Fund has launched an allocation to provide winterisation assistance for people affected by the Al Hudaydah crisis. The allocation targets 15,000 IDP families from Al Hudaydah Governorate, with each family receiving a one-off US$230 grant. Funding of almost US$4 million has been provided to four projects \u2013 implemented by a UN agency, a national NGO, an international NGO and the Red Crescent Society \u2013 that will cover nine governorates and reach 105,700 people.",

At lower elevations, average snow depth is observed in\n\nwestern and northern parts of the country, while\n\nnegative anomalies are seen in central, northeastern, eastern, and southeastern parts.\n\nAs of January 26, snow accumulation and snow water volumes are below normal in most basins across the country due to the prevailing deficit-precipitation\n\nAbove-average temperatures and below-average precipitation are expected from February through April\n\ndue to the prevailing La Ni\u00f1a conditions. Below-average\n\ndevelopment of snowpack and, consequently, below- average snowmelt runoff is expected in the coming months, likely to reduce water available for irrigated crops. While the first crop cultivation in the upstream areas is not expected to be affected by below-average water availability, crops in the downstream areas are more at risk. For the second crop cultivation, reduced seasonal water availability is expected in the country.\n\nGiven expectations for below-average snowpack development, the risk of flooding and landslides is expected to be less than usual. However, localized flooding is still possible because of storms during spring\n\nUPDATE ON SEASONAL PROGRESS Precipitation anomalies:\n\nFigure 1.

It is observed that below-average precipitation during January is leading to a steady increase in the precipitation deficits in the northern, southern, and southwestern parts of the country. As of January 25, cumulative precipitation deficits at the province level were worst in Farah, Nimroz, and Helmand (more than 50 percent\n\nFEWS NET Afghanistan\n\nFEWS NET is a USAID-funded activity.

This along with above-average temperatures has led to below-average snow accumulation as of January in various basins across the country and even declining snow water volume in some basins. Figure 3 highlights the decline in snow water volumes in the Arghandab, Hari Rod, Kokcha_Ab-i-Rustaq, and Kunduz basins since the beginning of January.\n\nFigure 3.

Dry weather conditions are expected to continue across the country through February 4. There is a 30 to 40 percent probability of more than 25 mm precipitation in the higher altitudes of the northeast while sporadic precipitation is expected in the northern, central, and southern parts of the country during the week ending February 11. The anticipated precipitation in the second week of February will not only improve the snow water volumes but will also be beneficial in the preparation of",

DTM identified an additional 685 displaced families (approximately 3,425 individuals) since the previous report, bringing the total number of internally displaced persons to at least 18,785 families (approximately 93,925 individuals) who have been forced to leave their homes due to armed conflict since the start of hostilities on 04 April 2019. During the previous two weeks, clashes and airstrikes reportedly continued in the areas of Qasr Ben Gashir, Khallat al Furjan, Al-Hira, Swani, Ain Zara, Al Aziziya, and south of Tajoura.\n\nWhile most IDP families are staying in private accommodation, over 3,900 IDPs are currently hosted in collective shelters. The majority of displaced households were identified in different neighborhoods of Tripoli, the Nafusa mountains and various locations along the coastal line of Western Libya. IDP families displaced to locations close to areas of conflict remain at risk, along with host community members providing them with shelter. Furthermore, over 3,685 migrants remain in detention centers in Tripoli and nearby areas and are also considered to be at high risk of being affected by the conflict.\n\nBased on rapid profiling of over 1,100 IDP families, 51% of displaced individuals are estimated to be female and 49% male. Furthermore, over 48% of IDPs were\n\nestimated to be children under the age of 18. Please refer to the full sex-age\n\nbreakdown on the left, and to pages 2-3 of this report for more details on location disaggregated figures.\n\nDisplacement timeline as per the cumulative number of IDPs tracked by DTM since the beginning of ongoing Tripoli clashes. dtmlibya@iom.int www.globaldtm.info/libya\n\n\n\nDISPLACEMENT LOCATION BREAKDOWN:\n\nPRIMARY AREAS OF ORIGIN\n\nAin Zara Qasr Ben Gashir Khallat Al Furjan Wadi Al Rabee Trig Al Matar\n\nSuq Al Khamees\n\nAT LEAST\n\nINDIVIDUALS DISPLACED SINCE 04 APRIL 2019\n\nIDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to IDPs displaced to\n\nAREAS OF DISPLACEMENT Abu Qurayn 1,000 IDPs displaced to Kabaw 1,125 IDPs displaced to Kikkla 1,225 IDPs displaced to Nalut 1,550 IDPs displaced to Rigdaleen IDPs displaced to Daraj IDPs displaced to Mezda IDPs displaced to Ziltun IDPs displaced to Al Qalaa IDPs displaced to Thaher Al Jabal IDPs displaced to Tawerga IDPs displaced to Alasabaa IDPs displaced to Kremya IDPs displaced to Zwara IDPs displaced to Arrayayna 3,525 IDPs displaced to Surman 3,550 IDPs displaced to Arrajban 3,850 IDPs displaced to Aljmail 4,450 IDPs displaced to Baten Aljabal 4,825 IDPs displaced to Jadu 4,925 IDPs displaced to Suq Alkhamees 7,425 IDPs displaced to Sirt IDPs displaced to Misrata IDPs displaced to Siddi Essayeh 10,500 IDPs displaced to\n\nAl Ajaylat Al Zahra Qasr Alkhyar Al Aziziyah Yefren, Mashashaya & Al Awiniyah Tripoli Center Hai Alandalus Al Khums Al Maya & Al Ameriya Bani Waleed Ain Zara Suq Aljumaa",

The cyclone affected nearly 200,000 people, of whom 42,000 were displaced by associated rainfall.\n\nDespite an increasing humanitarian caseload, transport access in some parts of the country remains a challenge.\n\nFAO warns of a spread of the desert locust infestation to the southern parts of the country as widespread hatching and hopper growth continue.\n\nFunding per sector remains disproportionate; more than half of the clusters have received less than 35 per cent of required funding.\n\nMulti-purpose cash grants are changing the lives of the IDPs in South Gaalkacyo.\n\nA flooded house in Hafuun district, Puntland. Photo: FAO\n\nKEY FIGURES\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nTropical Cyclone Gati aggravates humanitarian situation in Puntland\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Somalia has been aggravated by Cyclone Gati which made landfall in Bari region, Puntland on 22 November. Moderate to heavy rainfall associated with the cyclone together with some heavy storms affected nearly 200,000 people, including 42,000 displaced mainly in Iskushuban district. The cyclone caused the death of nine people and\n\ndisrupted livelihoods by destroying fishing gear, killing livestock, and flooding agricultural land and crops. The storm came against the backdrop of the triple threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, floods and an unprecedented desert locust upsurge which further deepened overall food insecurity within the country.\n\nAccording to FAO-SWALIM, the unusual heavy rains in the area also led to an immediate and short-term recharge of subsurface water sources and pasture growth, especially in Somaliland which has had a prolonged dry period since September 2020. However, these rains are not enough to address the water deficit in the area.\n\nThe forecast calls for light to moderate rains in most parts of the southern regions of the country. IGAD Climate Prediction & Application Centre (ICPAC) predicts drier than usual conditions likely to be recorded over most parts of Somalia, warning these conditions pose some risk to livelihoods. Farmers, pastoralists and all stakeholders are advised to take appropriate\n\nmeasures to mitigate the impact of these drier than usual conditions.\n\nSeasonal Deyr rains (October \u2013 December) have been erratic in Somalia, starting late in most parts of the country. However, the rains have caused widespread flooding resulting in displacement, suspected deaths and destruction of key infrastructure\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nSomalia Humanitarian Bulletin, 12 November 2020 | 2\n\nincluding roads, houses and farmland, according to humanitarian partners. At least 214,000 people have been affected by the Deyr rains and floods, mainly in Banadir, Jubaland, Hirshabelle, Galmudug and South West region since 23 October. Those affected include more than 53,000 IDPs and members of the host community in Baidoa town in South West State,\n\nwhose living conditions were already dire.\n\nThe Deyr floods follow the Hagaa season (June-September) riverine and flash floods, which affected over 545,000 people in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states.\n\nSurge of desert locust infestation emerges in southern Somalia\n\nThe desert locust infestation continues to spread in the southern parts of Somalia. In Banadir region, locusts were spotted hovering in parts of Dayniile and Kahda. Local farmers have reported that locusts have destroyed pastures, trees and gardens that had just began to grow. In Jubaland State, the situation is worsening, with more than 20 villages and pastoral\n\nareas surrounding Dhobley and Afmadow district affected. In South West State, swarms of locusts have been reported in Lower Shabelle and in the Bay region. An estimated 200 hectares of farmland have been destroyed in Afgooye-Marka. In Puntland, immature and mature swarms of desert locusts are present in many areas where breeding is ongoing due to favorable weather conditions following recent rains. It is projected that the hatched swarms will start hovering around areas with vegetation in search of food, depending on the direction of the wind. In Hirshabelle State, a huge presence of newly",

    "text": "26845\n\n\u00a9 UNICEF Nigeria/2019/Owoicho\n\nAnnual achievements In 2019, UNICEF Nigeria was able to reach or exceed many of its Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) targets, including the following:\n\n\u2022 A total of 1,395,010 children (aged 6 months -15 years) were vaccinated against measles through routine immunization, and an additional 800,000 children were vaccinated through UNICEF supported reactive campaign at the onset of the measles outbreak. \u2022 Almost one million conflict-affected persons were reached with water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services. \u2022 More than 350,000 boys and girls received psycho-social support services\n\nUNICEF also made substantial progress towards achievement of the following\n\n\u2022 At least 138,722 children (88 per cent of the target) with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) received treatment at UNICEF-supported treatment \u2022 A total of 811,947 children (77 per cent of the target) received learning\n\nUNICEF\u2019s Response and Funding Status\n\nUNICEF Appeal 2019 US$ 120.1 million\n\nFunding Overview and Partnerships In 2019, UNICEF requested US$ 120.1 million to reach 1.9 million people, including 1.6 million children1. Funds received amounted to US$ 85.3 million (71 per cent of requirement), with US$ 46.2 million received in 2019 and US$ 39.1 million carried over from 2018 (including funds received at year-end, intended to be spent during the following year). Significant funding shortfalls were observed in child protection (84 per cent), health (80 per cent), and WASH (50 per cent). However, funds available were utilized to ensure maximum achievement of life-saving targets. UNICEF sincerely thanks all donors who contributed to the 2019 HAC. These include the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Canada, Kuwait, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, the United States of America, Switzerland, Belgium, the European Union (ECHO) and the National Committees of UNICEF (NATCOMs).\n\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Needs The security situation in northeast Nigeria remained volatile throughout 2019, with ongoing conflict continuing to fuel and create humanitarian needs. By December 2019, 1.84 million people had fled their homes, with 77,152 persons becoming displaced over the preceding twelve months2. This included large-scale population movements into Maiduguri, Monguno and Damboa towns. Ongoing hostilities continued to reduce access to vulnerable populations. This became particularly pronounced in the second half of the year, when Nigerian security forces reinforced its positioned in large towns (\u201csuper camps\u201d) and withdrew from smaller towns and roads, especially across Gubio, Magumeri, and Nganzai Local Government Areas (LGAs) and along the Maiduguri-Damaturu and Maiduguri-Monguno roads.\n\nBy the end of the year, the number of inaccessible people was estimated to have risen to more than 1.2 million3, with humanitarian actors unable to reach many areas due to lack of security assurances by conflict parties. In addition to the threat of being caught in active hostilities or being targeted in attacks, humanitarian actors continued to face a series of bureaucratic impediments. Alongside military restrictions that limit the movement of humanitarian goods (including fuel), both civilian and military authorities introduced additional administrative processes hampering operations. Latest among these has been the adoption of a new \u201cNGO law\u201d by the Borno State Parliament in December to regulate humanitarian coordination and registration. Humanitarian actors remain concerned that elements of the new law run counter to national legislation and/or humanitarian principles.\n\nSummary Analysis of Programme Response\n\nIn 2019, a total of 138,722 children with severe\n\nacute malnutrition (SAM) accessed treatment at UNICEF-supported treatment centres in the three northeast states. This represents 88 percent of the UNICEF target for 2019. At the same time, UNICEF exceeded its target on counselling on infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices by reaching 360,754 caregivers of boys and girls aged 0-23 months (118 per cent of UNICEF\u2019s target). Coverage on the provision of micro- nutrient powder (MNP) reached 190,943 boys and girls aged 6-23 months (68 per cent of UNICEF\u2019s",

SITUATION ANALYSIS\n\nDescription of the disaster\n\nOn 1 October 2020, the city of Sake and its surroundings in the territory of Masisi, North Kivu province, experienced flooding resulting from heavy rainfall, causing material damage and loss of life. At least 10 people were declared dead from the floods and three people missing. The city of Sake is located about 25 km from the city of Goma with a population of 108,249 inhabitants. This rain caused erosion, leading to enormous damage with the bridge over the river Kihira, linking the Sake-Masisi road and Sake - Minova washed away. This also led to a breakdown in communication on the one hand, between Goma-Masisi and on the other hand, between Goma and South Kivu. Houses were washed away with all items they contained, schools were flooded, fields and grazing land for cows, sheep and goats were washed away. Some 3,825 people were affected and moved in with host families.\n\nIn response, DRC RC launched this DREF operation with support from IFRC to provide immediate and lifesaving support to the affected families.\n\nThis number was reached mainly due to success of hygiene promotion activities. Cumulative number of people reached with Health and WASH activities MDRCD031 \u2013 DRC Floods in Sak\u00e9 \u2013 DREF Operation Update 2\n\nP a g e | 2\n\nOverview of Host National Society Soon after the disaster, the DRC Red Cross in Sake deployed 30 volunteers to the different sites for first aid, search & rescue and rapid assessment. The volunteers also ensured the community was sensitized on the risks of water- borne diseases. Restoring family links was also ensured by volunteers who traced families of children separated from their parents. Details of achievements are in the detailed operational plan section below.\n\nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement in country Partner National Societies (PNS) present in the country, including the Belgian Red Cross, the Spanish Red Cross, the Swedish Red Cross, the French Red Cross and the Norwegian Red Cross, participated in the Movement's internal coordination meetings. In addition, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has a strong presence in the eastern provinces of DRC and provides analysis of the security situation to Movement partners.\n\nOverview of non-RCRC actors in country Refer to EPoA for details on actions by other actors.\n\nNeeds analysis. The needs of affected communities as described in EPoA have been addressed.\n\nOperation Risk Assessment\n\nAn unforeseen risk was the delay in the procurement of shelter tool kits to be replenished. This delay is due to changes in the global stock borrowing system. The lead time for completion of this process was indicated in Operation Update 1 as being six weeks (mid-March). Unfortunately, the container was expected to be loaded on truck at Dar es Salam on 20 March (CMA CGM Dar es Salam information) which means it is unlikely that Goods Received Note (GRN) will be obtained before 31 March. As such, a further one month no-cost timeframe extension is needed to finalize and ensure proper clearing and payment by 30 April 2021, which will amount to six (6) months operation timeframe. Past this date, the DREF operation will no longer be extended to ensure it remains in line with DREF Procedures.\n\nAnother risk in the EPoA which remains relevant is COVID-19 pandemic spread. The risk analysis for this threat and mitigation measures remains relevant.\n\nB. OPERATIONAL STRATEGY\n\nThe strategy proposed by the DRC RC focused on assisting the 3,825 people affected by the floods and 339 host families (1,695 people), with an immediate response including emergency shelter assistance and household items, information and awareness information on prevention of malaria, cholera and water-borne diseases; and community engagement as well as psycho-social support and first aid as needed.",

The attack occurred about 10 miles north of Goma, near Kanyamahoro town. The convoy, which included two clearly marked WFP cars, was travelling on the RN2 route.

The attack on the WFP convoy on February 22nd, 2021 was halfway between most south-easterly incident and Goma (yellow circle). Please note that the location for the attack on the WFP convoy is an approximate location estimate based on available information.\n\nPerpetrators and Purpose\n\nIt is still not clear who carried out the attack. Local authorities have presented no evidence to corroborate their claims that it was the work of the FDLR.2 According to witnesses, the perpetrators spoke Kinyarwanda and Swahili. Although FDLR members do speak these languages, it is also a common dialect used in Goma and the surrounding area. FDLR have stated they did not carry out the\n\nNor is the incident likely to be work of the so-called Islamic State\u2019s local proxy - Islamic State Central Africa Province (ISCAP)3 which tends to claim responsibility for such high-profile attacks very quickly. Indeed, several militia groups operate in and around Virunga, the area which lies along the DRC\u2019s borders with Rwanda and Uganda.\n\nIt appears most likely that the perpetrators were a local criminal gang or a militia unit who were carrying out an opportunistic kidnap, rather than a known militia group targeting a VIP.\n\nAmbassador Attanasio had visited a WFP school canteen on the morning of 22 February and was travelling to the small town of Rutshuru to view a community feeding project. From there he reportedly intended to visit one of the main volcanic sites in the area.\n\nThere are conflicting accounts as to whether the local government authorities knew he was travelling in the area, though it is highly likely that they would have known as he was making a formal visit to a local school. The Governor of North Kivu, Carly Nzanzu Kasivita, said that the convoy was stopped when warning shots were fired. The driver was then reportedly killed in order to pressure the rest of the convoy to comply with the perpetrators, who were either looking to capture the staff in a kidnap for ransom or to take the personnel to an ATM, from where they would have been forced to withdraw\n\nIt is known that neither the Ambassador nor his designated Close Protection Officer or the local staff members were wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the WFP vehicles were not armoured which would have been normal Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) for all delegates / ambassadors in semi-permissive environments like this one. This relaxation may be the result of knowledge that the route travelled on \u2013 RN2 \u2013 is a road used by over 90 per cent of UN and aid organisations to travel to the north of the area. The road had also recently been downgraded by the UN from red to yellow, and therefore the WFP convoy would not have been required to have an escort from MONUSCO (United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo).\n\nThe majority of aid organisations and diplomatic missions in DRC follow very similar security protocols",

UN flights carried the\n\npatients from Sana'a to hospitals in Amman and Cairo, as a temporary solution to reduce the suffering of Yemeni people until a more sustainable solution is reached.\n\n\u2022 WFP opened the Healthy School Meals kitchen. Fresh meals are distributed to 5,750 children in four schools in low\n\nincome neighbourhoods in Aden city, that host large numbers of IDPs and refugees. They are prepared with locally procured ingredients and in line with nutrition standards and local food culture. The Healthy Kitchen employs a cooking team of 35 staff members, 29 of which are women, and will scale up to reach 10,000 students in\n\nAden by the end of April.\n\n\u2022 Milling operations for WFP wheat at the Red Sea Mills (RSM) in Hudaydah continued in February. As of 29 February, a total of 23,734 mt of wheat flour were produced which was dispatched to WFP warehouses in Sana'a and Ibb\n\n\u2022 Food commodity prices have risen significantly, and food and other essential goods are becoming inaccessible for millions. The value of the Yemeni riyal has dropped 15 percent in the south and about 7 percent in the north, making life even harder for many families in Yemen, particularly those living\n\nacross frontlines.\n\n\u2022 Armed clashes between Ansar Allah and Internationally Recognized Government forces in Marib, Al Jawf, and Sana'a, led to new waves of displacement. In February, through its Rapid Response Mechanism partners, WFP provided\n\nimmediate food assistance package to 7,417 newly displaced households, as well as one-month commodity vouchers to 180 newly displaced households from Nihm, and commodity vouchers to 320 households in Marib city and Marib Alwadi.\n\nPhoto: \u00a9WFP Mohammed Nasher, Caption: WFP opened the healthy school meals kitchen in February, where fresh meals were distributed to 5,750 students in four schools in Aden.\n\nPage | 1\n\nWFP Response\n\n\u2022 During the February cycle, WFP delivered food assistance to\n\na total of 12.4 million people in 22 governorates. Of these, 9.4 million people received in-kind food assistance, 2.6 million people received commodity vouchers and 429,807 people received cash-based transfers.\n\n\u2022 In response to the increased fighting and large-scale population displacement in Hudaydah governorate in 2018, the UN established a Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) in June 2018 to assist newly displaced persons and ensure their most immediate needs are met. Displaced families are provided with WFP Immediate Response Rations (IRR) sufficient for five days. In February, WFP distributed 6,172 IRR kits through UNFPA and its cooperating partners.\n\n\u2022 Preparations in the northern governorates are ongoing to register 1.3 million households. In the southern governorates, over 1 million people have been biometrically registered against a target of 4 million.\n\nLivelihood and Resilience Projects\n\n\u2022 In February, WFP reached 156,016 beneficiaries with cash transfers for their participation in food assistance for assets (FFA) and food assistance for training (FFT). Activities were implemented in 33 districts across 11 governorates. Of\n\nwhich, around 400 newly enrolled women participated in literacy, sewing, project management and marketing training courses. Some projects were delayed while pending clearances from relevant authorities.\n\nSchool Feeding Programme\n\n\u2022 Under the January cycle, WFP assisted 1,277,685 students with school snacks (date bars in the northern governorates and high-energy biscuits in the southern governorates).\n\nNutrition Assistance\n\n\u2022 In February, WFP reached 262,666 children aged 6 to 59 months and 178,234 pregnant and lactating women and girls\n\n(PLWG) with its Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programme (TSFP) to treat moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). For MAM prevention, WFP reached 326,666 children aged 6 to 23 months and 495,000 PLW with its Blanket Supplementary Feeding Programme (BSFP).",

Vector-control activities are continuing in Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9.\n\nPOPULATION DISPLACEMENTS\n\nLac province Second preventive movement by people in a week due to security threats: On 7 October, IOM reported that 32 households (144 individuals) preventively fled the village of Kaiga-Kindjiria Centre (Fouli department) for the village of Magui, located in the same sub-prefecture but further away from the border areas with Niger and Nigeria, which are the most frequent targets of armed attacks. These newly-displaced are in urgent need of food, cash and NFIs. On 1 October, IOM had already assessed the situation of 200 households (710 individuals) who had fled the neighbor department of Kaya for similar reasons. Incursions and attacks by non-state armed groups (NSAG) continue to ravage the Lac province, resulting in internal displacement.\n\nHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE Mayo-Kebbi est\n\nMore than 33,000 flood-affected people in Mayo-Kebbi Est: Following heavy rains and recent floods, and despite considerable logistic challenges which hampered access, an interagency assessment mission was undertaken in the southern province of Mayo-Kebbi Est between 4 and 11 October. The assessment was conducted along two different axes: Bongor-Katoa and Bongor-Gounougaya-Finga. Preliminary findings gathered by UN agencies (FAO, OCHA, OMS, PAM, UNCHR et UNICEF) and international and national NGOs (Effective Solutions, AHEAS et OXFAM) revealed that 4,488 households (26,927 people) have been affected on the Bongor-Katoa axis, and 1,050 households (6,275 people) on the Bongor-Gounougaya-Finga axis: a total of 5,538 flood-affected households (33,202 people) in the assessed areas. The previous update on floods dating back to 29 September\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\nOCHA operational updates | 2\n\nhad estimated the number of affected people at over 26,000 in southern provinces. People expressed their most urgent needs for food, NFIs (blankets, mosquito nets, kitchen utensils), WASH, shelter and protection. The majority of flood-affected villages are located along the Logone river, an area prone to flooding due to the increase of water levels over the past few years. The local population also asks for the building of sustainable dams to protect them from rising water levels and potential flooding in the future. Humanitarian partners provided mosquito nets in several villages but there are still major gaps in needs. Overall, across the country, and based on both Government statistics and those of humanitarian partners, some 64,670 households (388,000 people) have been affected by flooding \u2013 to a varying extent - as of 29 September. Humanitarian partners continue to engage with the Government through its Crisis Committee, to monitor the evolving situation and support the response provided. This region is being flagged as a priority for response given the devastation witnessed in the villages by the mission, and this region\u2019s previous vulnerability to cholera.",

    "text": "21596\n\nEpidemiological Update Malaria in the Americas\n\n18 November 2019\n\nSituation summary\n\nBetween 2005 and 2014, there was an overall decreasing trend in the number of cases of malaria in the Region of the Americas; however, since 2015, there has been an increase in the number of malaria cases reported in the Region. This overall increase is due to the increase in cases over the last three years in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela along with increased\n\ntransmission in endemic areas of countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, Nicaragua, and Panama, as well as outbreaks in countries that were moving towards elimination (Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and Ecuador) (Figure 1).\n\nDespite this, in 2018, Guatemala and Honduras reported a significant decrease in malaria cases compared to the prior year, which has continued as of November 2019. El Salvador has not reported an autochthonous case in almost three years, while Paraguay and Argentina were\n\ncertified by the Pan American Health Organization/ World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) as malaria-free countries in July 2018 and May 2019, respectively.\n\nFigure 1. Number of malaria cases and deaths in the Americas, 2008-2018.\n\nSource: Annual Malaria Country Reports to PAHO/WHO\n\nSuggested citation: Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization. Epidemiological Update: Malaria in the Americas. 18 November 2019, Washington, D.C.: PAHO/WHO; 2019 Pan American Health Organization \u2022 www.paho.org \u2022 \u00a9 PAHO/WHO, 2019\n\nIn 2019, some countries have reported increases in malaria cases while other reported decreases. The following is a summary of the situation in countries of the Region of the Americas.\n\nIn Bolivia, after 3 consecutive years of no reported cases of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum), an outbreak due to this species has been reported in 2019 following an imported case from Brazil. Secondary cases were reported in the localities of Guayaramer\u00edn\n\nand the Sena, belonging to the departments of Beni and Pando, respectively, with a total of 12 cases. Bolivia is implementing the necessary containment measures to prevent the re- establishment of transmission by this species in the country.\n\nIn Brazil, the Amazon region1 is characterized by high endemicity of malaria, accounting for nearly 99% of the cases reported nationally. In this region, there was a 24% overall decrease in the number of cases reported during the first semester of 2019 (71,549 cases) compared to the\n\nfirst semester of 2018 (93,995 cases), notwithstanding an increase in cases in the states of Amap\u00e1, Mato Grosso, and Rond\u00f4nia. Between January and June 2018, the states that reported the highest numbers of autochthonous cases were Amazonas (36,776 cases), Par\u00e1 (21,535 cases),\n\nand Acre (15,245 cases), representing 41%, 24%, and 17% of all autochthonous cases reported in Brazil, respectively. During the same period in 2019, the states that reported the highest proportions/numbers of autochthonous cases were Amazonas (43%; 29,556 cases), Par\u00e1 (22%; 15,317 cases), and Roraima (13%; 9,137 cases).\n\nOf the 2,119 imported cases reported in the first half of 2019, 65% (1,370 cases) were from\n\nIn Colombia, since epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 42 of 2019 an outbreak has been occurring. there were 66,581 malaria cases reported, representing a 28.2% increase compared to the same period in 2018 (51,935 cases). Of the total cases, 65,480 were classified as\n\nuncomplicated malaria and 1,101 as complicated malaria. P. falciparum infection predominates, accounting for 50.9% (33,894 cases) of cases, followed by Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) with 48% (31,931 cases) of cases and mixed infection with 1.1% (755 cases) of cases; one case was due to P. malariae.\n\nIn 2019, 74.3% of cases have been reported by the departments of Choc\u00f3 (33%), Nari\u00f1o (20.1%), C\u00f3rdoba (12%), and Antioquia (9.2%). The departments of Choc\u00f3, Nari\u00f1o, C\u00f3rdoba, Norte de Santander, Meta, and Cauca have had outbreaks in 2019.\n\nOf the 1,967 imported cases reported in 2019, 96% (1,885 cases) were from Venezuela.",

    "text": "7186\n\nCountry Director: Samer AbdelJaber (Samer.AbdelJaber@wfp.org) Contact info: Flavia Brunetti (Flavia.Brunetti@wfp.org) Further information: www.wfp.org/countries/Libya\n\nOperational Updates\n\nIt is estimated that WFP delivered food rations to 95,384 people in November. This number will be confirmed as soon as reports are finalised. The UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) Libya, managed by WFP, continues to fly regularly between Tunisia and Libya. Currently, the UNHAS is flying to Tripoli and Misratah three times per week, serving the humanitarian and donor community. Flight frequency and destinations will increase based on access, needs and demand. In addition to activating the Logistics cluster for the Libya Humanitarian Country Team, WFP has now also activated the Emergency Telecommunications cluster, and is taking the lead on opening a UN hub in Benghazi.\n\nThe Way Forward \u2022 As Libya changes, so must WFP\u2019s response; as such, the operation is adapting and growing in response to the needs in-country. WFP\u2019s new programmatic directions will focus on livelihoods, helping to stabilise the reconstruction process in the country, including through the gradual recovery and strengthening of national safety net systems. The operation is exploring the possibility of expanding its assistance through a larger range of more innovative modalities including electronic voucher systems and a school feeding programme. \u2022 WFP will continue its food assistance to food insecure and vulnerable populations in Libya, and will also continue to respond to sudden onset emergencies as part of the Libya Country Team rapid response mechanism. \u2022 WFP is making efforts to improve data availability of food insecurity and populations most susceptible to becoming insecure, should the conflict worsen.\n\nWFP Operations\n\n6 Month (Jan-\n\nEMOP 200123\n\n\u2022 Currently, WFP monitors its activities through a Libyan third- party monitor, Moomken, while a Tunisian call centre makes 150 monthly calls to the people in Libya who have most recently received food. WFP trained their contracted call centre (based in Tunis) on Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and is conducting PDM calls through them, covering distribution locations throughout the West and South of the country. This is part of WFP\u2019s ongoing efforts to scale up monitoring and evaluation of its activities in order to ensure that feedback facilitates improvement of the operation. \u2022 Food insecurity remains a challenge due to protracted displacement, disruption to markets, and lower food commodity production. Livelihoods and access to basic social services have been affected by the conflict, exposing the most vulnerable people to a high risk of inadequate food consumption and forcing people into negative coping strategies such as spending savings, cutting the number of daily meals and reducing non-food related expenses, particularly in health and education. \u2022 Food imports in Libya have dwindled due to limited port access and road blockages. This has caused food prices to skyrocket. The prices of many staple food items, such as rice and wheat flour, have increased by as much as 200 percent compared to pre-conflict levels. \u2022 Violent clashes may continue to erupt throughout the country leading up to the planned presidential elections in 2019. Operational Partnerships \u2022 Partnerships: WFP primarily provides food assistance throughout Libya through two local cooperating partners (CPs), the Sheikh Taher Azzawi Charity Organization (STACO) and Ayady Al Khair Society (AKS). Efforts are underway to significantly expand the reliable partnership base in order to ensure that WFP can respond immediately to needs throughout the country. \u2022 Inter-Agency: WFP determines the most affected people in consultation with local crisis committees and partners. WFP WFP Libya Country Brief November 2018\n\ncollaborates with the Libya UN Country Team (UNCT) and the Security Management Team to coordinate its activities with other United Nations agencies, to assess the political and security situation and their",

    "text": "52576\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola Situation Report #39 March 12, 2021\n\noutbreak of Ebola in the DRC\n\nOn Wednesday, March 3, International Medical Corps discharged the first cured patients from the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) that we set up and manage in the town of Katwa, the current epicenter of the new outbreak, in the northeast. This latest outbreak, confirmed as the 12th in the country\u2019s history, comes only three months after the 11th outbreak, in \u00c9quateur province, was declared over in November 2020. It also arrived less than a year after the end of the 10th outbreak, also in the northeast and the worst in the DRC\u2019s history.\n\nThe first confirmed cases of the outbreak passed away before they could seek \u2022 medical care; the two patients who were cured and discharged were health staff who became infected while caring for other Ebola patients, due to insufficient decommissioned at the end of infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. So far, four of the 11 confirmed the 10th outbreak, the facility cases in the current outbreak have died. It\u2019s worth noting that most had not had cared for 3,859 suspected received the Ebola vaccine. As in previous outbreaks, two of every three and 422 confirmed Ebola confirmed cases are women, which could be attributed to their traditional role in patients. providing care, particularly to the ill, in the DRC. International Medical Corps\u2019 Rapid Response Team (RRT) deployed to Katwa 24 hours after the outbreak was confirmed, and has managed eight of the 11 cases confirmed so far, using a temporary structure converted into an ETC with the support of USAID\u2019s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. Among challenges encountered thus far are gaps in patient transport; poor IPC practices at health facilities; community resistance, particularly toward the Ebola vaccine (which some believe is the COVID-19 vaccine being distributed under the guise of an Ebola vaccine); and inadequate partner presence to support the response. The latter is partly a result of competing needs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the rollout of the COVID-19\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola Situation Report #39 March 12, 2021\n\nvaccine. International Medical Corps is distributing a survey to help the DRC government better understand factors that contribute to Ebola vaccine hesitance, as well as vaccine hesitancy in general, in this region of the DRC.\n\nSupport to COVID-19 vaccine introduction preparedness in the DRC Disease outbreaks of international concern such as Ebola and COVID-19 are common in the DRC. The introduction of an Ebola vaccine in 2018 enabled the country to mitigate the impact of the last three last outbreaks. Based on this experience, the DRC government hopes to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak through the rollout of any effective COVID-19 vaccine that becomes available. To support this rollout, the DRC has enrolled in the Global COVID-19 Vaccine Initiative (COVAX), which seeks to enable more equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines in low-income countries. Preparedness activities for the introduction and distribution of the vaccine, which will hopefully begin during the first quarter of 2021, are being coordinated by a national committee. Support is being sought from partners for the rollout of the vaccine, including demand generation, cold-chain and logistics management, waste management and post immunization surveillance. Vaccination will prioritize high-risk groups such as healthcare workers and other frontline staff, people living with comorbidities and the elderly. During February, International Medical Corps held community consultations across four provinces to identify common rumors and people\u2019s perceptions toward potential COVID-19 vaccines. We will share the results from these sessions with the Ministry of Public Health, which will use them to inform a national workshop to update the government\u2019s community engagement and communication plans, and prepare for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.",

Until present, a total of 1949 samples were tested for COVID-19. 3 COVID-19 related mortality cases were registered. Confirmed cases are in Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata and Surman.\n\nSecurity situation:\n\nTarek Al-Matar field hospital operated by Field Medicine and Support Center FMSC in Tripoli was hit. The attack caused a material damage to the building used by the medical team of the field hospital and one ambulance was damaged.\n\nWeryemma polyclinic in Tajura municipality was hit as a result of shelling. This polyclinic was fully functional and was providing Essential Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health services to an average of 60 beneficiaries per day. Health services are suspended.\n\nImmediate needs across the country: support to rapid response teams managed by NCDC, procurement and distribution of PPE, procurement of lab diagnostic kits and supplies for COVID, establishment and support to the isolation sites/wards (within or outside of hospitals), provision of training, health education/awareness materials.\n\nFunding situation (COVID-19)\n\nPillar 1: Country-level coordination\n\nNational authorities\u2019 update: MoH set up a schedule of technical meeting with specific pillar leads in Tripoli:\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nThe COVID-19 Supreme Committee in the East provided a list of the needed COVID-19 related health items, which was prepared by the Consultative Medical Committee. The list is divided into three parts; 1) infection control and personal protective equipment, 2) medical equipment and 3) lab equipment. Health sector key ask remains for the national authorities to release available national resources to fund COVID-19 response while international assistance will be of complementarity nature and fill the gaps.\n\nThere is a reported internal conflict in Zwara over the way forward with COVID-19 response. Earlier established sub- committees suspended their work in disagreement with the Emergency Committee.\n\nThere is information on the reported criticism of GNA authorities by LNA that COVID-19 donated supplies by other states (e.g. the latest donation by the African Union) do not get reached Benghazi.\n\nThe situation in Tobruk is of concern. The curfew is not in place following earlier killing of one of the main store\u2019 owners and clashes with local police.\n\nThe MoH informed health sector organizations \u201cto intensify, unify efforts and support commitment for the only communication channel represented by the International Cooperation Office at Ministry of Health, in order to prevent any confusion and avoid duplication in programs\u201d.\n\nThe National Oil Corporation (NOC) received a donation of medical supplies from \u201cTotal\u201d company for further distribution across the country. The NOC issued a statement to send out thousands of medical supplies and PPE items to health workers in the central and eastern regions of Libya.\n\nZwara municipality\u2019 authorities issued a statement that a number of trucks entered Libya from Tunisia (through Ras\n\nAjdair border point) without coordination with the emergency committee with no testing in place of drivers. The Presidential Council announced that the curfew would be from 06:00 PM until 06:00 AM starting on April 28 for a period of 10 days.\n\nThe military medical service of the western region provided support to Harawa and Al-Brega municipalities, including equipped ambulance, minibus, mobile phones and sim cards.\n\nField visits across the south indicate wide-spread absence of qualified staff, lack of follow up and attention from Tripoli and Benghazi, continued neglect of the requests from the south by the national authorities.\n\nHealth sector response: WHO took part in the regular COVID-19 NCDC technical committee meeting on 28 April.\n\nPillar 2: Risk communication and community engagement\n\nThe RCCE Working Group meeting was conducted. The minutes are available: RCCE WG google drive. Assessments and endorsed EIC materials are also available to all partners. The RCCE WG is aiming to develop a simple overview of all RCCE/CwC activities related to COVID-19. Organizations are requested to document key audio-visual and print media activities/materials in this folder.",

DTM identified an additional 1,455 displaced families (approximately 7,275 individuals), bringing the total number of internally displaced persons to at least\n\n16,460 families (approximately 82,300 individuals) who have been forced to leave\n\ntheir homes due to armed conflict since the start of hostilities on 04 April 2019.\n\nWhile most IDP families are staying in private accommodation, over 3,200 IDPs are currently hosted in collective shelters. The majority of displaced households were identified in different neighborhoods of Tripoli, the Nafusa mountains and various\n\nlocations along the coastal line of Western Libya. IDP families displaced to locations close to areas of conflict remain at risk, along with host community members\n\nproviding them with shelter. Furthermore, over 3,380 migrants remain in detention centers in Tripoli and nearby areas and are also considered to be at high risk of being affected by the conflict.\n\nBased on rapid profiling of over 1,100 IDP families, 51% of displaced individuals are\n\nestimated to be female and 49% male. Furthermore, over 48% of IDPs were estimated to be children under the age of 18. Please refer to the full sex-age breakdown on the left, and to pages 2-3 of this report for more details on location\n\ndisaggregated figures. DTM has conducted several rounds of rapid assessments on\n\nthe impact of conflict on availability of food, access to markets & cash as well as availability of services in affected areas.

Despite the limitations caused by the measures put in place against COVID-19, UNHCR\u2019s partners worked tirelessly to provide the humanitarian aid coordinated by UNHCR. During the year, more NFI kits and tents than before were distributed to IDPs and other conflict-affected people. Moreover, additional hygiene kits were distributed during protection interventions, as part of COVID-19 mitigating measures. These kits contained an increased quantity of soap to help preventing the spread of the virus. During protection interventions, UNHCR\u2019s partners also shared information to raise awareness on COVID-19.\n\nMain Objectives 1. Support the coordination of the cross-border humanitarian response through the Cluster system\n\n2. Identify protection risks and assistance needs and inform the overall response 3. Provide protection services and emergency\n\nFunding Level as of 9 December 2020 USD 56.7 million requested for the UNHCR cross-border humanitarian response Funded 100%\n\nassistance with core relief items and shelter 4. Build capacity of (local) humanitarian organizations 5. Fill critical gaps in the basic needs of IDPs where required and feasible\n\nMajor Developments\n\nOf a total population of 4 million people in north-west Syria, there around 2.7 million IDPs, who are considered to be in need of humanitarian assistance. New and protracted IDPs share the same urgent needs, in an area that has limited shelter options and where the fighting has caused the destruction of civilian infrastructure, including health facilities, schools, bakeries, and has disrupted the provision of basic services. With the Syrian Pound losing value in compari- son to other currencies, and with an increase in hostilities, the population is now facing more difficulties in addressing their basic needs.\n\nOn 11 July 2020, the UN Security Council Resolution that enables the cross-border humanitarian response through the Bab Al-Hawa border crossing was renewed for twelve months until 10 July 2021. Bab Al-Salam, the other border crossing utilized for transshipments to north-west Syria, was removed.\n\nThe number of positive COVID-19 cases rose steadily in north-west Syria in November. As access to health and ade- quate sanitation in the context of continuous displacement remains limited across the region, the humanitarian com- munity is actively operating to deliver lifesaving assistance while ensuring the safety of the people.\n\nFollowing the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2165, UNHCR established its cross-border activities from southern Turkey in July 2014. In 2020, through its own programme, UNHCR has partnerships with nine organizations - IRC, ACTED-REACH, WATAN, Bir Dunya Cocuk Dernegi (Children of One World; BDC), SHAFAK, NRC, Maram Foundation, SEMA and SRD - to assist displaced people by providing core relief items (CRIs), shelter support, and protection services. In addition, UNHCR is leading the Protection, Shelter/NFI (SNFI) and Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) Clusters. All Clusters closely follow the humanitarian developments in the conflict areas in north-west Syria and contribute to emergency preparedness response plans accordingly.",

Ambulance services are unable to reach the impacted population due to heavy shelling and airstrikes. Scores of families are reportedly trapped by the fighting inside Ad Durayhimi Town, but some have managed to flee to Al Hudaydah City and neighbouring districts.\n\nincluding hygiene kits, transit kits and food rations. In Al Hudaydah hub, over 11,000 households have received multi-purpose cash grants. Rapid response assistance has been delivered to 3,100 displaced households in areas covered by Aden hub, 2,300 households in areas under Ibb hub and more than 13,000 households in Sana\u2019a hub including 285 households living in nine schools within Sana\u2019a City.\n\nPartners are trying to evacuate the wounded from Ad Durayhimi Town. Ongoing conflict in Al Hudaydah Governorate has displaced over 50,800 households, of whom 50,100 (98 per cent) have received assistance\n\nAl Hudaydah and Al Saleef sea ports are open and operational. On 17 August, six vessels were at berth and four in the anchorage area in Al Hudaydah.\n\nMORE THAN 7.4 MILLION PEOPLE IN NEED IN AREAS WITH SIGNIFICANT ACCESS CONSTRAINTS\n\nIn July 2018, OCHA conducted focus group discussions in the humanitarian hubs with UN agencies, international NGOs and national NGOs to assess partners\u2019 perceptions of the humanitarian access situation across all 333 districts in\n\nThe results indicate that more than 1.4 million people in need of assistance live in districts with high access severity levels - 200,000 more people than in February 2018.\n\nDistricts with high access severity levels generally fall in the frontline conflict-affected governorates of Al Hudaydah, Sa\u2019ada, Hajjah and Al Jawf. More than 1.1 million people in need of humanitarian aid live in these governorates.\n\nParticipants identified access constraints in 94 per cent of districts in Yemen. The most prevalent constraints for all humanitarian actors were related to administrative restrictions, particularly those related to sub-agreements or denials of movement requests. Interference in the implementation of humanitarian activities was also among the most reported issues.\n\nThe full report can be accessed here.\n\nDistrict Access Severity, July 2018\n\nHigh Access\n\nSource: OCHA\n\nUPDATES FROM THE HUBS\n\nSa\u2019ada Hub\n\nLocal health authorities report that an airstrike on 9 August killed 46 people and injured 75 others when it hit a bus carrying children in a market in Dhahyan, Majz District in Sa\u2019ada Governorate. Most of the dead were children aged 10 to 13 years. The injured are receiving treatment in hospitals. The UN Secretary-General and various humanitarian partners have condemned that attack. The Secretary-General called for a prompt and independent investigation. UNICEF estimates that between March 2015 and June 2018, 2,398 children were killed in war in Yemen (1,640 boys, 709 girls and 49 of unknown gender). Another 3,652 children were maimed (2,674 boys and 978 girls).\n\nFive people were reported killed, and three others injured in Fallah area by three airstrikes that hit a funeral procession on 9 August. In Al Jawf Governorate, ground clashes in contested district of Al Maslub continues for the second week as both warring parties attempted to gain control of the whole district.\n\nDuring the reporting period, WHO donated large quantities of medicines and medical supplies to several hospitals in Sa\u2019ada. The supplies are expected to meet basic needs in these facilities for three months.\n\nWFP reported that its partners in Sa\u2019ada and Al Jawf have completed the July general food distribution.\n\nIbb Hub\n\nClashes erupted in Taizz City on 12 August, including around Al Jomhouri Hospital. Patients and medical staff were trapped inside the hospital, but were able to leave the facility later when clashes subsided. Local authorities have reported families moving from the city to other districts. The situation remains fragile. Reports suggest that four civilians were killed and 13 others wounded. During the reporting period, armed clashes were reported in Maqbanah, Al Qahirah District and As Silw District in Taizz Governorate.",

    "text": "63035\n\nWFP Southern Africa Regional Refugee Issue No.1 - July 2021\n\nRegional Overview\n\nRefugee and asylum seeker populations have faced notable hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in contexts of limited integration within hosting nations. Now, more than ever, there is a need for sustained investments in fostering self-reliance of refugee populations through progressive national policies, integration into social protection systems, predictable multi-year funding, and co\n\n-operation amongst nations for voluntary and safe repatriations and re-integrations. Critical also is sustained focus on preventing root causes of internal and cross- border displacements: conflict and violations of human\n\nWFP recognizes the contributions of supporting donors in this particularly challenging resourcing climate. However, resourcing remains insufficient to meet even the very basic needs of refugee households with WFP pushed to implement reductions in rations due to resourcing\n\nlimitations in some contexts. WFP also calls for the global community to sustain focus on the self-reliance potential for refugees which is threatened by diversions in resourcing\n\nand slow progress in the integration of refugees into national systems consistent with the spirit of international refugee frameworks.\n\nSouthern Africa hosts 6.5 million IDPs and 1.1 million refugees and asylum-seekers originating mostly from Rwanda, Central African Republic (CAR), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Burundi and South Sudan. WFP continues its dedicated support to refugees holistically addressing immediate food and nutrition needs, advancing resilience and livelihoods opportunities, supporting social cohesion through diverse support to host locations, and increasing focus on contributions to peace, stability and conflict sensitive programming across all locations to address root causes of displacement.\n\nThis update presents an overview of WFP\u2019s refugee operations in Southern Africa. It highlights some of the measures taken by WFP and partners to not only serve refugees better, but also to draw attention to critical funding shortfalls that threaten the food and nutrition safety, and protection, of refugees, as well as the necessary progress towards self-reliance.\n\nPhoto 1: WFP/Andy Higgins Photo 2: WFP/Yuri Andrade\n\nCountry Updates\n\nSince 2017, WFP has been assisting Congolese refugees in Luanda Norte with basic food and nutrition. WFP continues fund-raising activities to support self-reliance interventions in coordination with the Government and UNHCR. The voluntary repatriations of Congolese households to DRC was halted due to COVID-19 and related travel and border restrictions. There is need to ensure that preparatory work, policy cooperation, and maintaining favourable conditions in locations of origin (in parts of DRC) remain high on the agenda of all stakeholders in order to rapidly resume voluntary repatriations at earliest possibility\n\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO\n\nWFP supports refugees in DRC through cash-based transfers (CBT) in what is undoubtedly one of the most complex operating landscapes in the region. The adoption of CBT has enabled WFP to overcome the logistical challenges caused by natural hazards (floods), under-developed roads and infrastructure, and immense travel distance between refugee settlements and regional humanitarian hubs. The safety of staff and operations due to regular conflict en-route to assistance\n\nlocations remains a concern. WFP continues to work with the broader humanitarian community and authorities to address safe passage. In partnership with UNHCR, WFP is working with the WFP-UNHCR Joint-Resilience and Targeting Hub (hereby referred to as the HUB) to explore feasibility and pathways for introduction of resilience and livelihoods activities for refugees in DRC.\n\nIn 2021, WFP continues to work with authorities and UNHCR to\n\nleverage on the progressive refugee policies in Malawi. The gradual shift to cash-based transfers and an initial launch of some quick-win livelihood support activities continued. The roll- out of WFP Malawi\u2019s comprehensive refugee strategy for a tailormade response to better meet specific needs has been hindered by the impact of COVID-19 and the inability to proceed with the planned community participatory planning (3PA) processes. Renewed COVID-19 refugee mobility restrictions have increased dependency on food assistance, reduced access to alternative livelihoods and increased the over -congestion of Dzaleka camp. There is need for renewed",

Ongoing fighting displaced hundreds of people in Kandahar province, but the exact number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) is yet to be confirmed. Humanitarian actors with coordination of provincial authorities are assessing the needs of IDPs and will provide them with immediate assistance. Farmers and agricultural activities continued to be affected by ongoing fighting. All movements on the main highway-1 connecting Hilmand to Kandahar provinces reportedly resumed, however improvised explosive devices (IEDs) along the highway continue to pose a threat.\n\nIn Uruzgan province, clashes between ANSF and an NSAG continued along with the threat of IED attacks in Dehrawud, Gizab and Tirinkot districts. Two civilians were reportedly killed and eight others wounded by an IED detonation in Tirinkot\n\nIn Hilmand province, fighting between ANSF and an NSAG continued in Nahr-e- Saraj and Nawa-e-Barakzaiy districts. Targeted killings continued to be reported in Lashkargah city. The main road connecting Lashkargah to Grehk remained closed to all movements. Also, the threat of IEDs along main roads hindered civilian movement across Hilmand province. During the reporting period, two civilians were reportedly killed and 15 others wounded when their bus was hit by an IED on highway-1 connecting Hilmand to Kandahar provinces.

    "text": "43590\n\nConflict-driven displacement\n\nBriefing note \u2013 03 September 2020\n\nCrisis Impact Overview\n\nSince 16 August, fighting between the Taliban and Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) in villages of Khanabad district along the Kunduz-Khanabad highway, Imam Sahib district, and Kunduz city, all in Kunduz province (OCHA 27/08/2020), displaced approximately 64,000 people within these areas; approximately 28,000 were identified in assessments as\n\nrequiring immediate lifesaving assistance. The attacks on ANSF outposts and retaliatory ground offensives and airstrikes also resulted in the deaths of 17 civilians and in the injury of 23 (Humanitarian Web 25/08/2020) (OCHA 23/08/2020). Assessments from mid-August indicated that a high proportion of IDPs did not want to return to their areas of origin, fearing continued\n\nfighting (OCHA 25/08/2020). However close to 13,000 of the IDPs have returned to their homes in Khanabad district, where their needs will be assessed. Returnees are exposed to violence, IEDs, and mines on their return journeys. Further, households have long lived under conflict conditions and their coping capacities are likely severely strained. Kunduz city\n\nwas hosting a high number of IDPs prior to this recent fighting (ECHO 26/08/2020) in a province counting approximately 5,300 IDPs as of 20 August (OCHA last accessed 02/09/2020); available aid resources are likely to be scarce. Although fighting has stopped in Kunduz city, sporadic shooting has been reported (OCHA 27/08/2020); continued fighting is likely to force further\n\ndisplacement and will likely place civilian populations in danger. Since the start of 2020, at least 1,213 civilians were killed and 1,744 injured across Afghanistan because of security incidents (AIHRC 14/07/2020). Security conditions have deteriorated in Afghanistan, including the north-eastern region, since June, despite the start of peace talks between the government\n\nand the Taliban (Tolo News 25/08/2020) (ECHO 26/08/2020). Kunduz Province is one of the most conflict-affected in the country, and insurgent group presence is persistent across the province. On 22 August Kunduz city residents protested, accusing government forces of not adequately addressing the Taliban\u2019s threat (Tolo News 23/06/2020).\n\nAny questions? Please contact info@acaps.org\n\nACAPS Briefing note for START Network\n\nSectoral needs\n\nAggravating factors\n\nShelter and NFIs\n\nIDPs in Kunduz are residing with relatives or friends, sheltering in schools, or have put up makeshift shelters, all of which are inadequate (OCHA 25/08/2020).\n\nNGO assessments have identified that IDPs need shelter aid, though warned against establishing camps-style settlements that may encourage the spread of COVID-19 (OCHA 27/08/2020).\n\nIDPs need clean water, as well as sanitation and hygiene aid (OCHA 27/08/2020).\n\nAlthough Kunduz houses one of Afghanistan\u2019s only high-level trauma health facility, resources are restricted; there are 75 public health facilities in the province, however they often lack human resources to address trauma injuries or some basic health care and are controlled or influence by the Taliban (The\n\nJohanniter 11/2019). IDPs\u2019 movement will likely encourage the spread of COVID-19\n\nas there is a severe lack of soap and clean water sources to maintain appropriate hygiene (OCHA 27/08/2020). Cramped camp conditions and their movement back\n\nhome are likely to also contribute to COVID-19 spread. Health aid is currently being provided, including psychosocial support.\n\nIDPs need food aid (OCHA 27/08/2020). People in Kunduz province face Stressed (IPC-2) food security conditions as of August-September, and 14.2% of children\n\nunder five face some form of malnutrition in the province (Nutrition Cluster 2019). People are projected to face these levels into next year, which will likely make recovery difficult (FEWS Net 08/2020).\n\n17 civilians were killed in the fighting, and 23 injured (OCHA 23/08/2020). IDPs often are exposed to psychological trauma and may require special care. Civilians who are moving are exposed to IEDs and mines, along main throughways; children may be especially exposed to injury or death from explosive weapons.",

Further updates will be published as the situation\n\nFollowing an intensification of conflict in southern Tripoli, Tarhuna and Sirt, nearly 24,000 people have been forced to flee their homes, according to IOM\u2019s Displacement Tracking Update from 10 June. The majority of those displaced are in the east of the country, particularly Ejdabia (6,050 people) and Benghazi (5,250 peopl e), although other people have fled to the\n\nwest, particularly Bani Waleed (4,750 people). Some of those recently arrived IDPs in the East had previously been staying in Sirt and Ashshwayrif, before moving further east.\n\nThe majority of newly displaced people are reportedly staying with relatives, friends and host families. Collective shelters have also been set up by local authorities, which are currently hosting 3,180 IDPs in Ejdabia, Tobruk, Shahat, Bayda, Bani Waleed and Benghazi.\n\nIn Tarhuna and in Sirt, there has been reports of looting and other serious violations. This included reports of looting of the Tarhuna General Hospital, with the majority of staff reportedly fleeing. Along with ongoing insecurity, this presents a significant risk to the safety and security of those people that have remained. Despite this, there are reports that some families that had previously fled have been returning in order to check on their homes.\n\nThe Health Sector has re-established contact with its team inside Tarhuna and both mobile medical teams have resumed\n\ntheir work. The Tarhuna General Hospital has also partially re-started, particularly for paediatric, gynaecology, midwifery and general medical services. However, many health workers had left the city and therefore the hospital administration\u2019s main objective is for staff to return, but there remain concerns for their safety and security given the prevailing security\n\nAll other primary health centres and polyclinics in Tarhuna remain closed. In Sirt, the only functioning hospital is Ibn Sina Teaching Hospital and one polyclinic. There have been reports of an increase in number of patients presenting to Ibn Sina Hospital and the health authorities requested support to the intensive care and orthopedic departments.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all.\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nOCHA generic template | 2\n\nThe Ministry for IDPs continues working with municipalities to identify potential shelter facilities and assessing their response capacities. Authorities in the East are working with the different counterparts, including the Libyan Red Crescent Society (LRCS) and the interim Ministry of Social Affairs, in order to provide a consolidated list of those requiring assistance and information on their needs. In the South, new arrivals to locations such as Sebha and Brak Shati, have been staying in a\n\nnearby Technology College that was identified by the authorities as a temporary shelter. However, most people who initially fled to southern locations have since moved further east.\n\nAccording to a recent DTM rapid displacement survey, most commonly reported priority humanitarian needs are for non- food items, food, water and sanitation and health, including psychosocial support. The UN has received several requests from municipalities for assistance for those recently displaced. While humanitarian organizations start to scale up their efforts to respond to newly identified needs, these are complicated in many locations by ongoing insecurity and COVID-19 related restriction measures, particularly in relation to moving humanitarian supplies from the West to the East.\n\nSectors and humanitarian partners are currently mapping capacity to scale up response efforts. Coordination with the local authorities, as well as assessments, are ongoing to better understand the scope and scale of humanitarian needs and prioritize response efforts in line with available capacities. However, there are limited supplies in country which will need to be re-stocked and are likely to be impacted by COVID-19 and related restriction measures, both globally and in Libya.",

    "text": "55559\n\nConcept of Operations, May 2021\n\nSince the beginning of the crisis in 2011, ongoing fighting and widespread insecurity have continued to fuel large-scale\n\ndisplacements, increase vulnerabilities, and constrain humanitarian access across the country. According to the 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO), around 13.4 million people in Syria require humanitarian assistance. Of these, 6 million people are in acute need due to a convergence of factors arising from a sharp reduction in purchasing power, the loss of essential livelihoods and income, and limited access to basic goods and services.\n\nIn addition to this, the global outbreak of COVID-19 has further increased the scope and challenge of the overall response and\n\nled to a significant expansion in multi-sector needs all over Syria.\n\nThe scale of the humanitarian crisis continues to require a large-scale, sustained and comprehensive response from the humanitarian community to provide the affected population with critical cross-sectoral assistance.\n\nIn January 2013, the WFP-led Logistics Cluster was activated in Syria, as part of a streamlined effort to enhance coordination and operational capacity among the humanitarian actors active in Syria and augment the effectiveness of the overall response through the provision of a set of tailored logistics services.\n\nThe Logistics Cluster currently facilitates access to crucial logistics services for all operations across the region, including land transport for inter-agency humanitarian convoys, cross-border transhipment, and storage services. In September 2014, the\n\nWhole of Syria (WoS) approach was adopted as a result of UN Security Council Resolution 2165, bringing together separate\n\nregional operations into a single framework.\n\nLogistics Gaps and Bottlenecks\n\nAccess and security constraints remain the largest challenges faced by the humanitarian community in reaching vulnerable communities with life-saving relief supplies inside Syria. Based on consultations and regular review of gaps and needs, the Logistics Cluster, together with the partnering organisations, identified the following logistics gaps:\n\nNeed for consolidated logistics coordination and information sharing to reduce duplication of effort and increase operational efficiency.\n\nRestrictions on movement of humanitarian cargo and the need to maintain Inter-Agency Humanitarian Convoys for crossline missions.\n\nNeed for the coordination of cross-border transhipment services.\n\nNeed for common storage facilities inside Syria.\n\nIncreasing need for dedicated logistics capacity strengthening initiatives, particularly among national actors within Need for an air cargo transport service to the northeast in support of the COVID-19 response.\n\nThis Concept of Operations is a live document and the activities will be adapted and revised as the situation unfolds and further assessment results become available, including the possible provision of additional logistics common services as required by the humanitarian community.\n\nConcept of Operations, May 2021\n\nBased on the needs identified, the Logistics Cluster aims to provide the humanitarian community with facilitated access to\n\nsufficient and reliable logistics services and consolidated information related to logistics capacities to ensure a timely and uninterrupted supply of lifesaving relief items to affected populations in Syria and to enhance the capacity of the humanitarian community to deliver relief items to challenging locations.\n\nPlanned Activities\n\nAs lead agency of the Logistics Cluster, WFP fills logistics gaps faced by the humanitarian community in responding to the Syria Crisis through a range of different support services and activities. The following range of activities and services are not intended to replace the logistics capacities of individual agencies or organisations, but rather to fill identified gaps by facilitating the provision of common services. Based on the above, the following list, neither definitive nor exhaustive, aims to mitigate these",

Now we have seen an ITC with our own eyes, we are able to convince the community that these rumours are not - An Imam from one of the camps following a \u2018Go and See\u2019 visit to an ITC. As a result of persistent rumours and fear, many refugees are hesitant to visit facilities if they have COVID-19 symptoms. To combat misinformation and mistrust, Site Management and Site Development (SMSD) partners are conducting visits for refugees and community leaders to see COVID-19 treatment and prevention facilities to mitigate these challenges. Read more\n\nKey COVID-19 figures this week1\n\nMonsoon-related Incidents2 reported this week\n\nHost community/Cox\u2019s Bazar District information is from WHO daily update. All numbers are indicative only, as reported to SMSD Sector following rapid assessments carried out on the day of the incident. The numbers are not verified. Households and/or individuals directly affected by a specific incident, including people injured, relocated, displaced and with damaged shelters. These estimates do not include people who are indirectly affected ex. by not being able to access affected facilities. SMSD Sector cannot confirm that drownings resulted from the monsoon, however, the data captures all incidents (windstorm, slope failure, lightning, flood and drowning) reported in the camps during the monsoon season.\n\nISCG COVID-19 and Monsoon Weekly Update #20, 17 to 23 July 2020 | 2\n\nHealth Sector partners worked closely with Communication with Communities (CwC) Working Group to scale up messaging on the importance of wearing masks. As of 23 July, 10 Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Isolation and Treatment Centres (SARI ITCs) are active and ready to receive patients, including the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/High Dependency Unit (HDU) facility at Sadar Hospital with eight ICU and ten HDU beds. There are 391 and 126 active SARI ITC and isolation beds, respectively, in the camps. During the week, testing of refugees continued to increase: 434 refugees were tested, compared to 357 in the previous week. In host communities, testing dropped with 290 tests conducted compared to 379 the previous week. This is likely to be related to the recent introduction of a fee for sample collection in Government health facilities.\n\nWATER, SANITATION and HYGIENE (WASH)\n\nWASH Sector partners reached 256,271 individuals through a neighbourhood-based approach and 226,087 individuals through mass outreach with COVID-19 awareness messages in host and Rohingya communities. In the camps, partners provided soap to 37,990 households and family hygiene kits to 18,380 households, and installed 13,486 hand-washing stations: 18 in public places, 8 near latrine blocks, 1,508 tippy taps (a cost-effective hands-free device for handwashing) and 11,992 stools (with a bucket and tap) at household-level. Partners disinfected 59,841 WASH facilities and 3,128 public buildings. 5 new handwashing stations were installed at camp entry points, bringing the total of handwashing stations at camp entry points to 112.\n\nCOMMUNICATION with COMMUNITIES (CwC WG)\n\nCwC WG partners reached 191,174 people in the camps and host community with key COVID-19 messages disseminated through community engagement activities, including 42,835 neighbourhood-based sessions, 13,329 community consultation meetings, 1,363 group listening sessions, 413 video/film viewings, and an additional 9,555 sessions led by religious leaders. Partners organised 37 cascade trainings on COVID-19 with 289 staff and volunteers. Partners continued to deliver announcements on COVID-19 awareness via loudspeakers and megaphones on CNG/tom-tom/auto-rickshaws in 21 camps. For receiving community feedback and complaints, 76 information service centres in the camps, and 3 information service centres in the host community were operational. CwC WG published its 15th COVID-19 Risk Communication and Community Engagement Update, which includes the latest 4 audio materials on COVID-19.",

The decision also introduced the need to sell all subsidised bread bundles in a nylon bag for hygiene reasons. The national average price increased by 324 percent y-o-y, reaching SYP 208/bundle.\n\nAdditionally, on 19 July, the government announced that subsidised bread allocations would decrease to one bundle per person every three days; two bundles per family of two people every three days; and one bundle per family of three people on a daily basis. As of August 2021, the new bread allo- cations have started in Damascus, Rural Damascus, Hama, Tartous and Lattakia. Previously, subsidised bread bundles were distributed on a daily basis based on family size; with one bundle per family of one or two people; two bundles per family of three or four people; three bundles per family of five or six people; and four bundles per family of seven people or more.\n\nMoreover, the price of commercial bread increased by two percent m-o-m and by 73 percent y-o-y, reaching SYP 1,801/bundle. As-Sweida recorded the highest commercial bread price of SYP 2,109/bundle (up two percent m-o-m), followed by Rural Damascus at SYP 2,062/bundle (up one percent m- o-m). On the other hand, Al-Hasakeh recorded the lowest price of SYP 1,013/bundle (down one percent m-o-m), followed by Tartous at SYP 1,201 (down 12 percent m-o-m). Chart 2: Retail Prices of commercial bread, SYP Increase in National Salaries On 11 July, President al-Assad of Syria issued two legislative decrees raising the salaries and wages of civil and military work- ers and pensioners.\n\nDecree No. 19 of 2021 added a 50 percent increase to salaries and wages for all civil and military workers of the state, and raised the general minimum wage and the minimum wage for workers in the private, cooperative and joint sectors not cov-\n\nered by the provisions of the Basic Law for state workers to\n\nbecome SYP 71,515 per month.\n\nDecree No. 20 of 2021 granted military and civilian pension holders an increase of 40% in their retirement pension.\n\nFurther details of the two Decrees can be found following the two links in the footnote below2.\n\nOn 10 July, the Ministry of Internal Trade and Consumer Protec- tion increased the price of diesel to SYP 500/litre for all public and private sectors. For heating and transport diesel, this repre- sented an increase of 178 percent from SYP 180/litre. For baker- ies, this represented an increase of 270 percent from SYP 135/\n\nIn July 2021, the subsidized national average price of diesel more than doubled compared to June 2021 (up 114 percent m- o-m), reaching SYP 376/litre.\n\nChart 3: Formal and informal transport diesel prices, SYP**\n\nMoreover, the informal national average price of transport diesel increased by 29 percent m-o-m and by 340 percent since July 2020 reaching SYP 2,086/litre. The informal price remains four times higher than the formal price (SYP 376/litre) - Chart 3.\n\nSource: WFP\n\nDamascus recorded the highest informal price at SYP 2,663/litre (up 26 percent m-o-m), while Al-Hasakeh recorded the lowest price at SYP\n\n229/litre (down 10 percent m-o-m). Broken down by regions, northwest Syria recorded the highest price of informal transport diesel at SYP 2,664/litre (up 28 percent m-o-m), while northeast Syria recorded the lowest price at SYP 890/litre (up 16 percent m-o-m). Moreover, the informal national average price of heating diesel increased by 30 percent m-o-m, reaching SYP 2,129/litre.\n\nStaple cereals retail prices Chart 4: Retail Prices of Wheat Flour, SYP Wheat Flour M-o-m, the national average retail price of wheat flour through- out Syria remained unchanged, reaching SYP 1,870/kg, while it increased by 42 percent compared to January 2021 and 82 per- cent y-o-y. As-Sweida recorded the highest wheat flour price in July at SYP 2,057/kg (down six percent m-o-m), followed by Dar\u2019a at SYP 2,001/kg (up six percent m-o-m).

    "text": "35848\n\nPlease refer to the narrative in the report for details. Please note that \u2018Funding status\u2019 refers to the whole sector, while the results are only referring to one specific activity.\n\nFunding Overview and Partnerships\n\nIn 2020, UNICEF is appealing for US$ 294.8 million to continue its response throughout the country. UNICEF would like to express its gratitude to the Governments of Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Japan, Luxembourg, Sweden, Switzerland, the Syria Humanitarian Fund (SHF), United Kingdom, USA, and UNICEF national committees for the generous contributions provided in 2020.\n\nCurrently UNICEF has an overall funding gap of 48 per cent; these funds are needed to support the ongoing response covering the lifesaving multi-sectoral needs of over 3 million people, especially in child health, nutrition and child protection. Without additional funds an estimated 2 million children and women will not be reached with nutrition interventions, 1 million with primary health care and 300,000 with psychosocial support and case management.\n\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Needs\n\nIn 2020, children continued to bear the brunt of the conflict as Syria remains the largest displacement crisis in the world. Needs across the country remained extensive, with more than 11 million people (4.7 million children)1 requiring humanitarian assistance, including 6.2 million people internally displaced (2.5 million children).2\n\nDisplaced populations and returnees, particularly in Northeast and Northwest Syria, are vulnerable to outbreaks of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, due to unsanitary living conditions, overstretched health services and low coverage of routine immunization. Nine years of conflict have dramatically reduced access to basic social services, with concern that violations against children have been escalating.\n\nThe humanitarian situation has been further aggravated by the rapid devaluation of the Syrian Pound (SYP)\u2014since early June 2020, the SYP has lost half of its value within a month and reached historic new lows. In real terms, the SYP weakened by some 360% in a year since June 20193, contributing to eroding the purchasing power of the people together with high price inflation, rendering them more vulnerable in the face of any new shocks.\n\nIn Northwest Syria, over 1 million people were displaced between December 2019 and March 20204 due to an escalation of armed conflict; more than 1.4 million displaced people remain, living precariously in camps and settlements\u201480 per cent are women and children. Longer-term needs are increasing, particularly in health, nutrition and education services, even as urgent needs for shelter, food, water, sanitation, hygiene and protection persist. More children are likely to be out of school due to the economic crisis, as families struggle to cover education costs and may resort to harmful coping mechanisms such as child labour and child marriage. The nutrition surveillance system indicates that there is an increase in chronic malnutrition among children and acute malnutrition among pregnant and lactating mothers. In May, UNICEF participated in the first joint UN/SARC mission to seven newly accessible areas in western rural Aleppo to identify needs following shifts in control in January. Only 5 per cent of the population that left these areas during the crisis has returned; UNICEF in partnership with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) developed a response plan to meet some of the needs identified for the returnees.\n\nIn southern Syria, Rukban camp has not been reached by a humanitarian convoy since September 2019. Informal commercial supply routes from Damascus and Dhumer were closed off in February, further disrupting the delivery of food, fuel and medical supplies into the camp. Access is urgently needed to provide assistance to the vulnerable Rukban population and to support voluntary departures. In the Southwest of Syria tension has been increasing since February 2020, with repeated security incidents that resulted in the limitation of access by humanitarian actors. In light of the increased tensions in the Southwest of Syria, UNOCHA developed scenarios for possible humanitarian impacts, should the situation not ease. UNICEF developed a response plan feeding into the inter-agency response strategy for the south.",

    "text": "304\n\n5 \u2013 12 January 2018\n\nUNHCR FLASH UPDATE\n\nToday, UNHCR appealed for more resettlement places for refugees after reports of some 160 new deaths on the Mediterranean. UNHCR renewed its appeal for help in saving human lives by offering more resettlement places and other safe alternatives to protection for refugees, including through family reunification. This week alone, some 160 people were reported dead or missing in three separate incidents in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIn September 2017, UNHCR appealed urgently for 40,000 resettlement places for refugees in 15 priority countries of asylum and transit along the Central Mediterranean route. In all, 277,000 refugees are estimated to be in need of resettlement in these countries. States pledged so far less than one third of the 40,000 urgently needed resettlement places. Most of these are part of regular established global resettlement programmes and only a few represent additional places.\n\nPopulation movements\n\nSo far in 2018, 707 individuals, including 138 women and 85 children, were disembarked in Tripoli by the Libyan Coast Guard. On each occasion, UNHCR and partner International Medical Corps (IMC) provided humanitarian assistance upon disembarkation, including primary healthcare, refreshments, winter jackets and blankets. The majority of those disembarked this week were Nigerian and Malian nationals. UNHCR identified 143 refugees and asylum- seekers from Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Eritrea. In line with recent trends, most boats departed from Garabulli and surroundings, to the east of Tripoli. On 9 January, between 60 and 100 individuals were reported as missing in an incident at sea. No bodies were recovered by the Libyan Coast Guard. UNHCR Response\n\nIn 2018, UNHCR is expanding its protection activities throughout Libya, enhancing cooperation with authorities to respond to the humanitarian needs in the country. With the support of new international and national partners, UNHCR is expanding protection referral systems to ensure that internally displaced populations and persons in need of international protection have access to essential services and protection.\n\nIn anticipation of the return of internally displaced persons to Tawergha, some 40 km south of Misrata, the Protection Sector led by UNHCR has developed operational guidelines for returns. These guidelines cover the provision of services for returnees throughout Libya. Approximately 40,000 Tawerghan have been displaced for more than seven years. According to Libyan authorities, their return will take place in February 2018.\n\nUNHCR\u2019s Community Development Centres in Tripoli continue to provide assistance to refugees and asylum-seekers. This week, UNHCR, IMC and CESVI assisted 1,284 refugees and asylum-seekers with registration, psychosocial support, medical assistance, core relief items (clothes, blankets or winter jackets) and cash assistance. The large majority of refugees and asylum-seekers approaching the centres this week were from Sudan, Syria, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Palestine and Somalia. Outreach activities continued during the week, with assistance provided to nine refugee families living in and around\n\nKey Figures people of concern 45,129 registered refugees & asylum seekers 192,762* internally displaced persons\n\nUNHCR Coordinated Sectors Protection Sector Shelter & NFI Sector Cash & Markets Working Group\n\nKey Achievements in 2017-18 36,987 medical consultations (1,449 in 2018)\n\n113,362 IDPs and refugees received core relief\n\n3,327 IDP and refugee households received cash assistance (87 in 2018) 6,614 individuals registered\n\n5,665 rescue kits and 3,013 medical consultations provided at disembarkation points (338 and 57 in 2018)\n\n1,114 monitoring visits to 35 detention centres (34 visits in 2018) 1,424 detained refugees/asylum seekers released\n\n715 refugees and asylum seekers reached with solutions: 326 resettlement submissions and 389 individuals evacuated from Libya (162 to Italy and 227 to Niger)\n\nUNHCR Funding Requirements",

    "text": "16558\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\n4.0 million of Venezuelans are living abroad1. 3.2 million (80%) of which in Latin America and the Caribbean countries, according to updated official data. Due to complex and unpredictable developments of the Venezuelan situation, the increase in mixed flows of Venezuelan migrants and refugees in the region has continued.\n\nAs part of the region's ongoing efforts to adjust response structures at the national level to address Venezuelan migratory flows, countries continue to make adjustments and modifications in decisions related to their migration policies.\n\nIn this context, Peru and the United State of America announced different kind of measures to deal with Venezuelans flows on June 6th. The first one, informed that the Peruvian immigration control authorities, will only admit the entry to passport holders with a valid humanitarian visa starting from June 15th, 2019. Also, Venezuelan nationals may apply for a tourist, business or other migratory quality visas different to humanitarian visas, in any Peruvian Consulate abroad. On the other hand, the United Stated announced the acceptance of expired Venezuelan passports, both for the processing of visas and consular matters and for the entry into US territory. This measure is in line with the decree signed by the Venezuelan National Assembly on May 21st to extend the validity of Venezuelan passports for 5 years once they have expired.\n\nOn June 8th, after more than a 3 months closure (February 23th) the Venezuelan Government re- opened the main border crossing points with Colombia. The Colombian migration authorities informed that around 74 thousand people entered and left Colombian territory through the border crossings between Norte de Santander (Colombia) and T\u00e1chira State (Venezuela), during the first day of the border opening; specifically more than 34 thousand Venezuelan citizens entered to Colombia, while about 40 thousand returned to their country.\n\nIn Chile, through the Decree N\u00b0 42.383 of June 20th, the government announced the implementation of the consular tourism visa for Venezuelan citizens as response to the expected increase of Venezuelan migrants since the implementation of the humanitarian visa in Peru. The Decree establishes as requirement for entry (recreational, sporting, religious or other similar purposes) the obtention of a consular seal giving the right to entrance and permanence for a maximum of 90 days. This is valid for individuals entering Chile without the purpose of immigration, residence or the development of remunerated activities.\n\nSince 2015 and per end of June 2019, 1,916,700 million residence permits, and other forms of regular status have been granted approximately in Latin American and the Caribbean countries. As for some of the current ordinary and extra-ordinary regularization mechanisms, the latest available official figures of granted visas and permits are as follows:\n\n1 UNHCR/IOM joint PBN and DTM\n\nRESIDENCE PERMITS AND OTHER FORMS OF REGULAR STATUS (FROM 2015)\n\n* 596,077\n\n2017 to April 2019 as per April 30, 2019 2017 to February 2019\n\nIncludes Permiso Especial de Permanencia (PEP) / Special Stay Permit + Foreigner Cards Special Stay Permit (PEP)\n\nIncludes all categories\n\nDTM & Assessments In June 9,274 interviews were carried out through DTM flow monitoring exercises in 2 countries. DTM in Brazil focused on people living in the streets and occupied buildings in the cities of Boa Vista and Pacaraima, covering 7,040 people. Ecuador has started out its 5th flow monitoring exercise in 7 municipalities, reaching 2,234 people. DTM reports were presented to government institutions and partners in 2 countries: in Brazil reports have been distributed to 200 users, whilst in Panama to one. Additionally, in Mexico 6 assessments have been carried out in the reporting period on service pathways for Venezuelans in vulnerable conditions.\n\nTemporary accommodation During the reporting period, temporary shelter was provided in transit and destination areas in Argentina (58), Brazil (902), Costa Rica (4), Curacao (35), the Dominican Republic (7) Ecuador (660), Guyana (2) and Uruguay (4) accommodating a total of 1,672 Venezuelans. Specifically, in Argentina, Venezuelans were supported in the City of Mendoza through the implementing partner Fundaci\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica Argentina de Migraciones (FCCAM), at Hogar \"P. T. Rub\u00edn\"; people accommodated stayed an average of 15 days per family.",

    "text": "31209\n\nFACT SHEET\n\nNorth of Central America Situation May 2020\n\nAround 470,000 refugees and asylum-seekers from the North of\n\nCentral America in the world and\n\n318,590 internal displaced people in Honduras and El Salvador have\n\nbeen forced to flee their homes because of brutal violence.\n\nAs at May, countries in the region continue to maintain official borders\n\nclosed to prevent the spread of\n\nCOVID19. Cases of violence and internal forced displacement in\n\ncountries of origin continue unabated.\n\nUNHCR and partners have been identifying and assisting people with\n\nunaccompanied children, SGBV survivors (women and LGBTI people),\n\nmen victims of recruitment witnesses of serious crimes.\n\nASYLUM SEEKERS AND REFUGEES By country of origin\n\nSource: Based on data provided by governments to UNHCR as of Dec-19.\n\nGovernments in the NCA maintain curfews and quarantine to avoid a new wave of COVID-19 infections, which continues to impact UNHCR\u2019s presence in communities and people of concern\u2019s jobs and livelihoods. These restrictions also worsen the situation for people at risk in countries of origin, who will face additional difficulties to flee when persecuted. Internal forced displacements continue despite the pandemic.\n\nLGTBI community leaders in the NCA continue to report violence and persecution by gangs that aim to force them into criminal activities or threaten their lives because of who they are. They also experience limitations in accessing humanitarian aid, health care, and economic opportunities during the pandemic.\n\nUNHCR continues to ramp up efforts to support government responses to support IDPs, refugees and asylum seekers to cope with critical needs, like access to protection, food, housing and healthcare, including mental health.\n\nIn addition, UNHCR continues to support reception conditions for deportees and returnees and collaborates with partners and governments in the identification of protection needs among those in quarantine.\n\nFUNDING (AS OF 28 MAY 2020) US$ 113.6 M\n\nrequested for the NCA situation1\n\nUNHCR and the Izabal Health Directorate in Guatemala launched a communicating with community\u2019s project where a loudspeaker on a car travels through border communities and Puerto Barrios sharing information on UNHCR and COVID-19 prevention measures. \u00a9UNHCR\n\nFACT SHEET > NCA Situation / May 2020\n\nUNHCR Response and Strategy\n\nUNHCR works with over 70 partners in the region and supports states to implement their national plans under the Regional Comprehensive Protection and Solutions Framework (MIRPS). The MIRPS is a pioneering application of the Global Compact on Refugees. In May, the OAS Permanent Council approved the establishment of a voluntary fund for the MIRPS, which will allow\n\nfor the mobilization of resources to help implement action plans in each country.\n\nMain Activities\n\nAlongside governments, partner organizations, civil society, faith-based organizations, development actors and UN Agencies, UNHCR undertakes protection and solutions activities, including:\n\nSafe reception and admission\n\nUNHCR in Belize supports the Refugees Department in undertaking their duties, including through the donation of an infrastructure to resume registration while ensuring COVID-19 prevention measures. UNHCR in Honduras and El Salvador is supporting the government response to COVID-19 through the conditioning and endowment of reception centres for deportees.\n\nAdvocacy and Coordination\n\nIn Belize, thanks to UNHCR\u2019s advocacy, all family members no longer must be present for the renewal of asylum certificates. In Guatemala, UNHCR is coordinating with the Ministry of Labour to support refugees and asylum seekers who have not been able to renew or apply for work permits during the pandemic. Under the Protection Cluster, UNHCR El Salvador coordinates the delivery of cell phones and tablets to support child protection interviews. UNHCR is coordinating the delivery of food and hygiene kits through government institutions and community leaders in Honduras and El Salvador. In Costa Rica, UNHCR is working with the Migration Authority to ensure that COVID-19 measures do not affect the due process for NCA asylum seekers. Also, UNHCR works with translators to provide Miskita versions of health prevention information and access to RSD processes.",

Between 300 \u2013 800 households have reportedly been displaced from Saida Khadija neighbourhood in the west as a result of the renewed conflict. A further 60 families have also been displaced from other neighbourhoods. There are periodic closures of checkpoints and therefore people are not always able to enter and exit Derna, restricting their movement. Humanitarian access to Derna is severely limited and no humanitarian supplies are reported as entered since mid-March. The most urgent needs are in the health sector, however protection concerns for civilians remain serious and the first food shortages are also being reported. Chronic shortages of fuel remain. The humanitarian community call on all parties to immediately allow safe and unrestricted access to Derna for humanitarian actors and urgently needed humanitarian goods.\n\nThe tightened encirclement and closure of Derna, imposed by the Libyan National Army (LNA), has been ongoing since July 2017. Periodic escalations of armed conflict occur, as witnessed since mid-April when the LNA announced it would start a large-scale offensive against armed groups in Derna. During this time, the LNA managed to advance towards Ain Mara in western Derna, and since then airstrikes, shelling,\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)\n\nLibya | Derna Flash Update\n\nartillery fire and fighting between armed forces has been ongoing at various intensities. Until 15 May, the fighting was contained to areas with limited civilians.\n\nThe primary areas where clashes are taking place remain in Al Hila (south of Derna city), Al Fatayih (east of Derna city), Ain Mara in the west and Dhar Al Hamr to the south-west, encircling Derna city from all sides. There are also reports of clashes in Martuba (south-east of the city) and reportedly shelling of Al Fatayih Al Jadeeda and Sahel al-Sharki areas is taking place.\n\nHowever, the most recent intense fighting took place in Saida Khadija (west of Derna city) which has resulted in the displacement of most of its residents to other neighbourhoods, Al Bayda. Tobruk and Benghazi. Sources report that between 300 \u2013 800 households have displaced, the majority to Tobruk. Also on 22 May, 21 families were displaced from Hay Al Salam neighbourhood to Al Bayda and remain with their relatives who live there. Furthermore, on 21 May reportedly approximately 40 families were displaced to Martuba, where most are sheltering in a school.\n\nThere are periodic closures of checkpoints and thus people are not always able to enter and exit Derna. For example, following several days of closures, the Martuba checkpoint east of Derna was reopened on 20 May allowing for civilian movement in and out of the city, at least for several hours a day. The Corsah (Kirsa) checkpoint, west of Derna, has been reportedly closed since 18 May. As of 21 May, the LNA continued to impose a ban on the entry of essential goods including food items and humanitarian assistance including medical supplies, as well as fuel. No humanitarian goods have entered since mid-March according to humanitarian actors. As a result of these closures, local residents report shortages and price rises in basic foodstuffs including bread and vegetables and a lack of entry of fuel required for the functioning of several installations.\n\nOn 20 May, the hospital in Derna city announced that it would only be able to admit urgent life-threatening cases due to the ongoing shortages of basic medical supplies including syringes and oxygen tanks as well as medical staff, many being unable to travel to the hospital due to insecurity. Prior to this, the hospital was forced to close the pediatric ward and women\u2019s health unit on 17 May.\n\nHumanitarian Overview\n\nThe main ongoing humanitarian needs continue to be: medicine and medical supplies; access to cash; fuel to ensure the continued functioning of critical installations, such as hospitals and water installations and spare parts for the desalination plant.",

UNHCR continues to support the self-sustaining livelihood activities of refugees and asylum-seekers under the San Rafael Shelter Project, led by implementing Partner Living Water Community. The shelter, which houses 19 adults and 13 children, continues to move towards sustainable livelihood efforts, which include the addition of a Cash- for-Work agricultural project involving six refugees and migrants, supported by UNHCR funding, who are expected to soon begin earning money from the sale of their crops. Living Water Community continues to meet the maintenance and repair needs of the shelter, while also working to improve the property through additions such as an upcycled playground for the children using car tyres and necessary infrastructure for the continuation of livelihood options. The property houses a diverse profile including LGBTI, indigenous Warao, as well as three locals who provide much needed support.\n\n18-59 YEARS REGISTERED WITH 17.3% UNDER-18 YEARS\n\n53.8% 85.7% MALE VENEZUELAN\n\n*Figures are as at August 31st 2020. Registration at UNCHR premises had been temporarily suspended from March 13 to May 26 due to COVID-19. 3,402 individual records were inactivated in April due to registration documentation being expired for more than six months.\n\nCOMMUNITY HOTLINE COMMUNICATION\n\nCalls to the UNHCR hotline continued to increase for the third consecutive month, with a 4% increase\n\nrecorded in August. The number of queries relating to detention continued to rise with a 43% increase recorded for August when compared with July. The highest number of queries related to the provision of multi-purpose cash assistance, which formed 28% of the queries received this month, also recording an increase of 29% when compared to the number of queries received on this in July.\n\nCASH-BASED INTERVENTION (CBI)\n\nIn August, 172 multi-purpose cash grants were approved for individuals facing protection risks with very limited or no ability to achieve self-reliance. Applications for cash assistance continued to demonstrate the\n\nheightened protection risks faced by refugees and asylum-seekers due to the onset of COVID-19 and challenges of the operational context. Eighty-three percent of applicants reported not being able to meet their basic needs, while 39% of applicants were facing eviction or homelessness and 78% indicated that either they or their children/household members were reducing the quality and quantity of their food intake.\n\nEMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE Implementing partner Living Water Community (LWC), provided 1,205 beneficiaries with emergency food assistance in August. Beneficiaries apply for emergency food assistance remotely through an online form and once approved, receive QR coded e-vouchers that are redeemed at 29 supermarkets in communities\n\nEDUCATION ACCESS\n\nDespite funding and connectivity challenges, 40 new beneficiaries were able to access remote education\n\nservices in July through Equal Place, with a total of 993 students accessing lessons for this month. Advocacy through collaboration with the Catholic Education Board of Management (CEBM) and other denominational school boards continues, to ensure as many migrant and refugee children as possible are accepted into schools.\n\nACCESS TO MEDICAL HEALTH SERVICES UNHCR implementing partner Family Planning Association (FPATT) conducted 152 consultations on sexual and reproductive health for 125 refugees and asylum-seekers during August in addition to 12 pediatric care consultations. These were delivered through a combination of telehealth and static clinic\n\nMENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOSOCIAL SERVICES\n\nPsychosocial support was provided for 104 refugees and asylum-seekers in August, with implementing partner Rape Crisis Society facilitating 111 counselling sessions, including victims of sexual and gender- based violence. LWC also conducted psychosocial interventions for 37 individuals in August, with sessions held for an additional five victims of trafficking to help treat with the intense trauma of those experiences.",

Qasr bin Ghashir, Ain Zara, Wadi Al Rabei and Swani districts witnessed heavy artillery shelling and gunfire between the Government of National Accord (GNA) and Libyan National Army (LNA)-affiliated forces as fighting continued for the seventh day. Both sides continue to use airstrikes against each other; airstrikes hit Souq Al Khamis, Souq Al Ahad and Ain Zara. Another airstrike hit the diplomatic suburb of Ain Zara while another one hit Swani district.

The plan covers distribution of additional life- saving medical supplies and trauma kits to frontline responders and referral hospitals with the deployment of Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs). WHO, UNICEF, IOM, UNFPA, IMC and IRC have committed to contribute to the plan which will target Tripoli and the surrounding districts. MSF-H is in close coordination with the health sector to provide additional support as per the identified needs. 2. On Wednesday, April 10, WHO distributed emergency medical supplies and four trauma kits to Tripoli Wounded Affairs Directorate (TWAD), Tripoli Health Service Department (THSD) and Emergency and Health Service department. The supplies will enable the field emergency teams, field hospitals and ambulance services to sustain their first and second line responses and ambulance services. 3. TWAD is running seven medical teams that act as first line responders. THSD is running four teams that act as second line responders. Emergency and Ambulance service is running 12 teams that are providing field ambulance and referral support to both THSD and TWAD.

    "text": "63842\n\nThis report is produced by OCHA Syria in collaboration with humanitarian partners.\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nAs of 22 August, ground clashes and artillery shelling continue across parts of Dar\u2019a governorate, in particular Dar\u2019a al- Balad. Military reinforcements reported around Tafas, Um Al-Mayathen Saida towns and the M5. There are reportedly ongoing attempts among the parties to reach an agreement, however, no consensus has been reached.\n\n38,600 IDPs are\n\nregistered by SARC in and around Dar\u2019a city as of 17 August. This includes almost 15,000 women, over 3,200 men and elderly and over 20,400 children. About 1,500 IDPs residing in six collective shelters. However, informal reports indicated that as many as 45,000 people may have been displaced from Dar\u2019a al-Balad.\n\nSaraya crossing point has been closed since 12 August. Between 21 and 22 August, it was reported to be temporarily open to allow women, children and the elderly to exit.\n\nAccording to UNRWA, almost half of the Palestine camp population \u2013 329 families - have been displaced to Dar\u2019a city. About 300 families are staying with relatives in Dar\u2019a governorate and 29 families are residing in the collective shelters. Almost 300 families remain at risk of displacement from the camp. All roads into the camp and the roads between Dar\u2019a and Muzeirib have been closed since 29 July and access from Dar\u2019a camp to the city for pedestrians is a challenge.\n\nAccess to services and goods within Dar\u2019a al Balad is extremely challenging; food shortages and electricity outages have been reported. Due to continuing insecurity, delivery of flour to two bakeries (Tishreen and al Balad) is still not possible. Dar\u2019a authorities have therefore reallocated this flour to existing bakeries in Dar\u2019a city, Bosra Esh Sham, Tiba, Da'el to help meet the needs of IDP populations. The distribution of bread to IDPs is supported by SARC and Al Birr.\n\nPlans are underway for an inter-agency convoy to deliver critical items including ready-to-eat meals, flour, water, purification tablets, jerrycans and medical supplies. The humanitarian community continues to advocate with all parties to facilitate the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance to all affected areas and communities, including Dar\u2019a Al-Balad.\n\nHUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND RESPONSE Humanitarian partners are assisting displaced families and host communities in Dar\u2019a city and surrounding areas as outlined below.\n\nFood Security and Agriculture: WFP has delivered 1,500 ready-to-eat (RTE) packages in Dar\u2019a city, 1,213 packages have been distributed to families in the collective shelters and host community as of 17 August. An additional 5,160 RTE packages for about 25,800 people is planned to be dispatched soon. In parallel, SARC in\n\ncollaboration with other partners have provided food assistance to over 13,000 IDPs in Dar\u2019a city and Nasib\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises.\n\nAs of 17 August, with support from WFP, SARC is also completing the distribution of the July cycle food assistance to several areas including areas hosting IDPs from Dar\u2019a al Balad. This will cover over 71,600 people including IDPs and host communities in Nimeh, Nasib, Busra ash-Sham, Kahil, Al Jeeza, and Atman.\n\nHealth: Health partners together with DoH continue to provide critical health services and medical supplies. As of 18 August, Nour Foundation and UNICEF in collaboration with DoH conducted about 2,638 medical consultations related to gynaecology, paediatrics, internal medicine, mental health, psychosocial support and performed surgeries. A new medical clinic focused on internal medicine started operations in Dar\u2019a city. Six mobile teams supported by WHO, UNFPA and UNICEF and operated by DOH, Al Birr, Nour Foundation, Al- Sham Association for Health and SFPA are providing medical services in the six collective shelters, host communities and surrounding areas. Three of these mobile medical teams are supporting Ash-Shajarah, Hrak and Busra Al Sham sub-districts. In addition, six ambulances from the Dar\u2019a Health Authority - donated by WHO in 2020 and 2021 - are on standby to support any referral services as required. Health partners have set up an epidemiological investigation team to monitor, prevent and respond to possible disease outbreaks. Since 27 July, SARC and other partners have supported health services and reached 1,328 people through the mobile teams. In addition, over 3,300 people have been reached with health awareness/promotion sessions, COVID- 19 infection prevention and control activities while 400 people have received first aid.SFPA with support from UNFPA provided maternal and reproductive health to about 547 women and adolescent girls.",

Reports estimate that 600,000 people in Sofala, Zambezia, Tete, Niassa, Manica and Inhambane provinces have been\n\naffected and are in need of humanitarian assistance. So far 150 people are reported dead (including 66 due to flooding before the cyclone impact) and more than 1,500 injured, with the toll expected to increase in the coming days. Prior cyclone-related flooding had already displaced 17,000 people and very likely thousands more were displaced after the\n\ncyclone passage. Houses, health, and education facilities have been severely damaged in the provinces affected, particularly in and around Beira. Extensive damage to livestock and planted crops has also been reported.\n\nBriefing note \u2013 19 March 2019\n\nSource: OCHA 17/03/2019\n\nAny questions? Please contact our senior analyst, Jude Sweeney: js@acaps.org\n\n\n********* [PAGE 1 END] *********\n\n\n********* [PAGE 2 START] *********\n\nCrisis impact\n\nTropical Cyclone Idai - a Category 3 cyclone - made landfall on the city of Beira, Sofala province, over 14-15 March, with maximum sustained winds of 210 km/h, decreasing to 70 km/h while moving through Sofala and Manica provinces, towards Zimbabwe. Ninety percent of the city has been damaged or destroyed. The most affected provinces are Sofala, Manica, Zambezia, Inhambane and Tete. (Logistics Cluster 17/03/2019) Estimates indicate 600,000 people have been affected by the cyclone and need humanitarian assistance. (ECHO 18/03/2019) The full impact of the cyclone is not yet clear because of damage on roads and on the communications infrastructure; however, many parts of Beira and other districts are severely damaged. (IFRC 16/03/2019) The death toll stands at 150 people dead and more than 1,500 people injured. (ECHO 19/03/2019) The figure is likely to increase as search and rescue teams gain access to affected areas. Heavy rains are expected until 21 of March, with further risk of flooding in the affected areas. (Logistics Cluster 19/03/2019)\n\nIn the days prior to the cyclone\u2019s landfall, severe flooding related to the approaching cyclone had already impacted several districts in Sofala, Zambezia and Tete provinces, affecting over 140,000 people. Some 66 people died and more than 100 were injured as a result of the flooding. At least 17,000 people have been displaced by the floods and are sheltering in 15 transit centres. The flood-affected population have likely been additionally affected by the cyclone(OCHA 15/03/2019) (Club of Mozambique 15/03/2019).\n\nShelter: More than 12,000 houses have been destroyed by flooding since 9 March in Zambezia and Tete. People evacuated and displaced due to loss of property are being hosted in 15 transit centres in Tete and Zambezia. (OCHA 12/03/2019) There is no report on the current shelter situation situation of the population displaced. The impact of Cyclone Idai on shelters is still unknown. It is likely that thousands of homes will be damaged or destroyed.\n\nFood and livelihoods: Extensive destruction of livestock and planted crops has been reported, with 168,000 hectares of crops destroyed in Zambezia and Tete\n\ndue to flooding and cyclone impact. (UN News 15/03/2019)\n\nAs this happened before\n\nthe main harvest season, food insecurity in the region will be highly affected. Nampula, Tete and Niassa were among the worst affected areas by drought, also reporting high levels of food insecurity. Food distribution is being provided by local and international organisations. Needs assessment of the population in isolated areas is not available, mainly due to access constraints. In Beira city markets and businesses are not functional, no report on impact on trade, although it is likely the disruption of imports will further impact the food situation.\n\nACAPS Briefing Note: Tropical Cyclone Idai, Mozambique\n\nHealth: The emergency room of the Central Hospital in Beira is non-operational due to extensive damage, while other parts of the hospital were flooded but reportedly functioning. (OCHA 18/03/2019) Local and international media also reported that 18 hospitals have been destroyed by the cyclone (Al Jazeera 14/03/2019; Club of Mozambique",

Information is preliminary and is subject to change as the situation on the ground evolves.\n\nCategory 5 Hurricane Dorian made landfall over northwest Bahamas on 1 September as the strongest hurricane in the Bahamas\u2019 history, causing extreme flooding as well as power and connectivity outages in the two most affected areas of Abaco Island and Grand Bahama Island.\n\nA World Food Programme (WFP) IT staff member was deployed to Nassau, the Bahamas, on 30 August to support initial ICT preparedness measures prior to Hurricane Dorian hitting the Bahamas. He will be joining the rapid needs assessment mission to the affected areas starting on 4 September, coordinated by the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) and national authorities.\n\nThe Emergency Telecommunications Cluster or Sector (ETC or ETS) has not yet been activated. The Crisis Connectivity Charter was activated on 4 September to ensure satellite equipment prepositioned in Panama is readily available in the most affected areas to support initial response efforts. A number of Global ETC partners are currently in Barbados conducting a capacity building exercise for CDEMA. Some of these partners will be deployed to assist response efforts in the Bahamas.

An estimated 76,278 people have been affected with as\n\nmany as 13,000 homes damaged or destroyed. At this stage, all projections on humanitarian needs are subject\n\nto post-impact verification once the Government issues an all clear.\n\nHurricane Dorian is the strongest hurricane on record to hit the Bahamas in modern times, causing severe impact to communications, power and transportation primarily on Abaco and Grand Bahama islands.\n\nThe Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) has assembled two Rapid Needs Assessment Teams (RNAT) who began a three-day assessment to Abaco and Grand Bahama islands on 4 September to identify gaps in humanitarian needs. The RNATs consist of 18 people from CDEMA participating states, Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA), Global Affairs Canada (GAC), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Port Managers Association of the Caribbean (PMAC), the private sector, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and WFP. The ETC is ready to support the response as required.\n\nEach RNAT team will deploy with a drone that will be used to capture high resolution aerial imagery for situation monitoring and mapping. WFP is providing technical support to set up the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) team and coordinate flights, data capture and processing.\n\nFollowing the initial damage caused by the hurricane, the Global ETC has confirmed the possibility of using data connectivity equipment in Panama (nine satellite terminals are currently prepositioned) and\n\nfree bandwidth for up to three months through the activation of the Crisis Connectivity Charter. Up to four\n\nprepositioned satellite terminals are to be shipped on the next available flight from UN Humanitarian",

The aim is to assist those suspected of or confirmed as COVID-19 positive.\n\nDuring the emergency all foreigners pending regularization will be considered as regulars. The Superintendence of Migration informed that Temporary Stay Permits (PTP) will also remain valid and no sanctions of fines will be applied.\n\nOn 23 April, President Martin Vizcarra announced the fourth extension of the quarantine and curfew measures until 10 May.\n\nKEY IMPACTS, NEEDS AND RISKS .\n\nAn increased risk of human trafficking was reported by partners and the media. Current mobility restrictions and the impossibility to work heightens the risk of refugees and migrants\u2019 exploitation and abuse by traffickers. The return of many refugees and migrants to Venezuela and their vulnerability to the human trafficking networks acting near borders increases that risk and generates great concern.\n\nFood insecurity, evictions and lack of affordable housing or shelter continue heightening the risks for vulnerable refugees and migrants, who are not able to comply with the quarantine measures in place.\n\nCases of gender-based violence are on the rise. Most refugee and migrant women remain following curfew and quarantine with their aggressors. GTRM partners are working with the Ministry of Health (MINSA) and the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations (MIMP) to support survivors with psychosocial support and adjusting the referral pathways.\n\nRESPONSE .\n\nCBI and Health\n\n\u2022 Partners shared a new CBI modality to reach more vulnerable refugee and migrant families through virtual basic baskets of goods. This assistance would allow them to withdraw goods from a network of small supermarkets and grocery stores using their ID and a QR code received in their mobile phone. GTRM members supported the Ministry of Health (MINSA) establishing and approving a protocol to assist survivors of gender-based violence.

    "text": "7154\n\nUN URGES ACTION TO AVERT HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE IN YEMEN\n\nOn 7 December, the preliminary results of the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) Food Security Analysis were released, indicating that without humanitarian food assistance over 20 million people in Yemen, representing two thirds of the population, would face severe food insecurity (IPC Phase 3+, that is people in crisis and above on the IPC five phase scale). Alarmingly, for the first time during the conflict in Yemen IPC Phase 5 (people in catastrophe) is observed, meaning that 63,500 people currently in this phase and are barely surviving. However, without large-scale food assistance, the number would be 238 000, three times higher. Only one other country in the world - South Sudan - has people suffering catastrophic food insecurity and even then, the number of people at Phase 5, at 47,000, is much smaller. Overall, 17 per cent of the Yemeni population (about 5 million people) are in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and 36 per cent (about 10.8 million people) are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). Ongoing hostilities remain the main driver of worsening food security, IDPs and those hosting them are the most vulnerable. The people most at risk of starvation are in Hajjah, Al Hudaydah, Sa\u2019ada ad Taizz governorates. The economic crisis and resulting high food prices, disrupted livelihoods and high levels of unemployment also affects those not in conflict areas - the cost of the minimum/survival food basket is 150 per cent higher than before the conflict.\n\nAs a result, large numbers of households in most districts across the country are forced to engage in negative coping strategies, including reducing the number of meals or size of food portions, consuming less preferred foods and prioritizing children\u2019s consumption. In addition, households have also resorted to practices that will undermine their longer- term food security, such as selling animals and household items. In response to the situation, WFP is scaling up its food aid operation to target 12 million people per month with food and nutrition assistance next year, up 50 per cent from the 8 million targeted every month this year. The 12 million figure represents 10 million people severely food insecure and 2 million displaced people in acute need. Food aid alone will not be sufficient to end hunger. To do this, much more is needed. The five priorities to prevent more people sliding into IPC Phase 5 and possible famine are: 1. Stop attacks on civilians and civilian 2. Allow all imports of food, fuel and medicine; 3. Provide more foreign exchange and pay civil 4. Support the scale up of the humanitarian response; and 5. Support the UN Special Envoy\u2019s efforts to end the conflict.\n\nIPC ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY PHASE DESCRIPTIONS\n\nSource: IPC/FSAC Yemen.\n\nUPDATES FROM HUBS\n\nAL HUDAYDAH HUB\n\nIn the two weeks preceding the ceasefire agreement in mid-December, there were intermittent armed clashes and artillery exchange in several areas in and around Al Hudaydah City. Airstrikes continued sporadically in several locations including near the Al Mina, Bajil and Sukhnah, and in Ad Durayhimi and At Tuhayat districts. In Hajjah Governorate, armed clashes continued in Haradh and Hayran districts. According to the Protection Cluster, there were 114 civilian casualties in the reporting period, 35 of them fatalities. Damage was reported to houses, farms, businesses, mosques and water infrastructure.\n\nDuring the reported period, WFP completed the November food basket distribution, reaching 33,582 families in Al Hudaydah Governorate, 155,467 beneficiaries in Hajjah Governorate, and 81,318 families in Al Mahwit Governorate. An international NGO, Norwegian Refugee Council, is still conducting the November food distribution in Hajjah which has so far reached 60,111 families.\n\nSANA\u2019A HUB\n\nIn the second week of December, the Protection Cluster reported that fighting continued in the main conflict areas. In Sirwah, Marib Governorate, an airstrike hit homes, while in Al-Haymah and Al- Kharijiyah, Sana\u2019a Governorate, an airstrike hit homes and farms.",

    "text": "56942\n\nBriefing note 26 May 2021\n\nMount Nyiragongo erupted on 22 May 2021 at 19:00 local time near the city of Goma, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Two lava streams emerged from the volcano at a height of 1,800 metres. One stream flowed east in the direction of Rwanda, while the other headed towards Goma, stopping 300 metres from Goma International Airport (UNICEF 23/05/2021). As at 26 May, 1,400 metres of roads were potentially affected by the lava (UNOSAT 26/05/2021).\n\nAt least 25,000 people were displaced in Sake, 25 km northwest of Goma, and 7,000 travelled towards neighbouring Rwanda to seek refuge (UNICEF 23/05/2021). 31 people died, and 24 were injured by the lava flows; 40 adults and 170 children are missing. Three villages and one neighbourhood in the city of Goma were destroyed by the lava, including more than 3,500 houses and five schools (OCHA 25/05/2021). Over 20,000 people (4,500 households) lost their home and are currently living in host communities, public spaces, and schools (IRC 23/05/2021).\n\nThe most affected neighbourhoods are Buhene and Kibati, located north of Goma International Airport, where eight health centres and eight schools have been damaged (OCHA 25/05/2021). Power lines and water supplies have also been damaged, preventing 500,000 people from accessing water and electricity (USAID 25/05/2021). The Government and humanitarian partners have set up a hotline to provide assistance to the population (OCHA\n\nStrong aftershocks were recorded in Rwanda on 26 May, including a magnitude 5.1 earthquake under Lake Kivu (Al Jazeera 25/05/2021). A magnitude 4.7 earthquake in northeast Goma on the same day and fear of a second eruption triggered the evacuation of the city ordered by local authorities (Al Jazeera 27/05/2021).\n\nThe volcano\u2019s crater appears to have refilled, which is likely to cause new fissures opening or another volcano eruption (Al Jazeera 25/05/2021). More aftershocks are expected after the eruption, along with the risk of a second eruption (Al Jazeera 27/05/2021).\n\n\u2022 The ash cloud from the volcano is likely to cause respiratory diseases (OCHA 25/05/2021). Any questions? Please contact info@acaps.org\n\nThe road between Goma and Rutshuru, which is the main route for food and humanitarian assistance into Goma, is blocked by lava (Reuters 23/05/2021). Alternative routes through Uganda and Rwanda are possible but complicated by COVID-19 restrictions (OCHA 25/05/2021).\n\nThe roads leading to northern parts of North Kivu are damaged, preventing the delivery of goods in Beni territory, where 280,000 people have been displaced since January 2021 as a result of conflict and insecurity (UNHCR 25/05/2021). Congolese construction company Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Congolaise de Construction has started works on 25 May to reopen the road (Actualite.cd 25/05/2021).\n\nGoma and Bukavu airports are closed, with repercussions on the delivery of humanitarian assistance by air (OCHA 25/05/2021).\n\nOver 25,000 people are displaced in the town of Sake, 25 km northwest of Goma, following the volcano eruption. Schools and government buildings are used as shelter. The displaced population is in urgent need of shelter and relief items (UNHCR 25/05/2021). 7,000 people who had fled towards Rwanda are beginning to return to Goma (RFI 23/05/2021). People lost their belongings when they fled \u2013 either left behind, burnt, or looted (OCHA 25/05/2021).\n\nEight health centres were destroyed in North Kivu during the eruption, limiting access to healthcare for the affected population. Ten people were poisoned by lava gas in Kibati. Occupancy rates in open health centres have increased from 65% before the eruption to 100%. There has also been an increase in patients needing gynaecological\n\nand obstetric services (OCHA 26/05/2021).\n\nThe volcano eruption damaged a critical water pipeline in Goma, cutting off access to potable water for 500,000 people (USAID 25/05/2021). Humanitarian partners are currently assessing WASH needs. The displacement to and from Sake, where 19 cases of cholera were recorded in the last two weeks, is likely to worsen the outbreak. The disease might further spread when IDPs return to Goma (UNICEF 23/05/2021). There",

A rapid WFP food security assessment estimates that 336,600 people in urban and rural areas could fall into severe food insecurity.\n\nAs of 14 June, PAHO/WHO report 1,625,290 cases and 78,629 deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as 834,176 recovered cases.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis caught Argentina and Ecuador as they were near default, with Argentina defaulting in May and Ecuador working to avoid the same fate as it stands to lose some 600,000 jobs during the pandemic and see poverty rise by four per cent, per the Quito Chamber of Commerce. Mexico was in recession, while Brazil recorded its fourth straight year of unemployment over 10 per cent in 2019.\n\nGuatemala\u2019s COVID-19 Response Plan for $26.2 million has mobilised $6.8 million, representing 26 per cent coverage of funding needs. UN agencies account for about 30 per cent of mobilized funding ($2.1 million), while international NGO contributions make up the remainder ($4.7 million). Nearly half of the funding mobilized so far is addressing food security.\n\nAdditionally, the United States resumed deporting migrants to Guatemala on 9 June, almost a month after Guatemala stopped taking in returnees as a precaution. Official data indicates that at least 186 out of the 2,160 Guatemalans deported since mid- March tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe numbers presented are for orientation and not conclusive.

    "text": "2965\n\nPROTRACTED VIOLENCE CONTINUES TO PUSH YEMENIS INTO DISPLACEMENT\n\nThe Shelter/NFI/CCCM cluster reports that as of 12 April protracted violence in the Al Hudaydah and Taizz governorates has displaced 19,145 households of whom 9,838 have been assisted. This new wave of displacement further adds up to the three million Yemenis who have already faced the shock of having to flee their homes, two million of whom remain displaced across the country. 89 percent of IDPs in Yemen have been displaced for more than one year. According to the Protection Cluster, displaced people increasingly face protection risks, including those living in public buildings, collective centres or spontaneous settlements. Deteriorating shelter conditions, such as overcrowding and unsanitary IDP settlements, have led to increased spread and susceptibility to communicable diseases. Many IDPs are in need of shelter, food, water, sanitation and access to health services. They are vulnerable to exploitation, indebtedness, and negative coping mechanism, such as begging, child labour,\n\nrecruitment by armed groups and early marriage. As conditions deteriorate in Yemen, humanitarian partners have prioritised assistance for some of the most vulnerable communities, including IDPs, returnees and host communities. In 2018, a total of 266,000 IDP households are targeted to receive assistance as part of the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan, including rental subsidies, core relief items, emergency shelter and legal aid. USD 198.7 million and unimpeded access are required. Multi-cluster humanitarian response to new displacement driven by the conflict in Al Hudaydah and Taizz governorates is still ongoing. However, a lack of implementing partners on the ground and the authorities\u2019 delay in releasing the necessary approvals have negatively affected the response. In between January and March 2018, the Shelter/NFI/ CCCM cluster reached approx. 227,000 people as per the breakdown below.\n\nHOUSEHOLDS ASSISTED JANUARY - MARCH 2018\n\nReach 20,074\n\nReach 76 0.63%\n\n1,981 3.55%\n\nReach 3.65%\n\nReach 60\n\nReach 0%\n\nSource: Shelter/NFI/CCCM Cluster\n\nUPDATES FROM THE HUMANITARIAN HUBS\n\nGovernorates covered by the humanitarian hubs (as of 01 March 2018)\n\nAL HUDAYDAH\n\nSource: UNOCHA\n\nAl Hudaydah: WFP reported that the estimated value of the assistance destroyed in the fire that occurred in its warehouse in Al Hudaydah city on 31 March amounts to US$5 million. The lost supplies were meant to contribute to the rations of at least 1.8 million beneficiaries for a month\u2019s period. WFP is using reserves to partially cover the gap and prevent any disruption to the monthly distribution process. A new fire broke out on 16 April in a WFP mobile storage unit for non-food items in Al Hudaydah city, no significant damage was reported. At least two humanitarian organisations reached and responded in Al Khawkhah district during the reporting period. However, access to the eastern part of Hays district remains challenging due to continued shelling. In Al Hudaydah city, humanitarian partners have provided NFI, cash and hygiene assistance to some 1,500 families, including IDPs. In Hajjah governorate, 158 families among the most vulnerable in Abs district received cash assistance.\n\nAden: Queues have been witnessed at private fuel stations in the governorate, while government-run fuel stations are not functioning. Fuel is available in the unofficial market at a higher price. In nearby governorates, however, fuel is available with no change in price. Cut-off hours of electricity have increased during the reporting period to 6-8 hours a day, compared to two hours a day in the previous weeks. According to a displacement tracking exercise, 305 new IDP households were reported in Aden in the past week. Reportedly, 244 other new IDP families have been displaced in the districts of Khanfir, Lawdar and\n\nZingibar in Abyan governorate and 61 in Tuban and Al Had districts in Lahj governorate. 299 suspected diphtheria cases were reported in the hub as of 8 April, including 141 cases in Al Dhale\u2019e, 67 in Aden, 12 in Lahj, seven in Abyan and one case in Shabwah.",

Preliminary assessments indicate that at least 10,000 shelters and 1,600 facilities have been destroyed or damaged. As at 24 March, out of the 124,381 people living in the four camps, 45,000 are estimated to be displaced (ACAPS). According to SMS, as of the 27 March, 10,311 persons remain displaced in other camps, of which 53% are female. (Numbers are subject to constant update due to the fluidity of the situation and population\u2019s movements).\n\nUnder existing agreements, the response will be implemented within the Area Focal Agencies (AFA) areas of responsibility for displaced persons and immediate response, IOM, UNICEF and UNCHR in their respective areas, whilst reconstruction will be undertaken by IOM and UNICEF in their respective areas. Additional support may be required and requested by AFA from additional response partners.\n\nThe following are WASH Sector recommendation for the fire response. This document will be regularly updated as the situation evolves and based upon needs. The below activities must be duly coordinated with CiC, AFA, WASH focal points and communicated to the WASH Sector.\n\nRestore the access to water\n\nIn affected camps (8E, 8W, 9) Whilst previous infrastructure is repaired where possible, temporary activities will provide minimum Sphere standards for safe drinking water;\n\n\u2022 Provision of chlorinated water through monitored water tucking (minimum FRC at point of consumption of 0.5mg/l). \u2022 A minimum of 15 lt/pers/day are available, queuing times and maximum distance should be observed\n\nwhilst recognizing access based on topography and disability. \u2022 Aquatabs should be distributed where access to a safe water source cannot be guaranteed, or where\n\nit is believed that individuals will use STW/DTW water for drinking (approx. to cover 1-month use). Aquatab distribution must be accompanied by how to use explanation, promoted, and monitored. FRC\n\nspot-check at HH water container is recommended.\n\n\u2022 Water bottles distribution should be avoided. Although not ideal, they are acceptable as temporary measure (not beyond 10 days after the fire). Requires efforts in promoting appropriate plastic disposal.\n\n\u2022 Distribution of water storage containers (minimum 2 water containers) to every affected HH \u2022 Available water quantities should include provision for additional persons participating in the clean-up\n\nIn the camps affected by influx of displaced persons\n\n\u2022 Ensure existing STW/DTW and existent water supply schemes are operating as designed. \u2022 Increase pumping hours and water availability when possible (3/4 hours supply window to be granted and queues monitored)\n\nWASH Sector Guidance note \u2013 Fire response Cox's Bazar WASH Sector - March 2021\n\n\u2022 Distribution of WASH hygiene items to displaced populations ensuring the needs of females are recognized who may be living in temporary locations.\n\nRestore the access to sanitation\n\nIn affected camps (8E, 8W, 9)\n\n\u2022 Emergency repair interventions to damaged latrines and bathing shelters: replacement of slabs/satopan when needed, replacement of latrines superstructure with simple tarpauline/bamboo or\n\nwooden timbers. \u2022 Emergency hand washing stations to be installed in the proximity of latrines; recommended to have some daily workers to refill the handwashing stations and to provide soap (subsidized activity)\n\nIn the camps affected by influx\n\n\u2022 Speed up the maintenance of existing latrines and bathing places \u2022 (if hosted HH will stay for long period in displacement) foresee increase of desludging activities\n\nHygiene promotion and diseases prevention In affected camps (8E, 8W, 9)\n\n\u2022 Restore, when possible, community structures and WASH committees and get their feedback on how better address public health risks with population in distress and in low resources setting \u2022 Promote hand washing with soap (link with infrastructure and hand washing stations construction); promote tippy-tap installation (for instance: where plastic bottles have been distributed) \u2022 Distribute hand-sanitizers where no hand washing stations are available or where water is scarce/far",
